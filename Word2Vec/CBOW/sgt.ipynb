during world war it was also the starting place of the expedition in it was named as one of the top in the state of arkansas by construction the arsenal was constructed at the request of governor james in response to the of life and of the many native who were passing through the state on their way to the newly established territory thirty six acres were on the of little rock by major robert b of the us army the land had been previously used as a by the local club john a for the federal government the construction originally was for the construction of the arsenal but proved the budget was later increased to work began on the tower building in and it was the first permanent structure of the arsenal to be built being originally constructed to store ammunition the building was designed with foot thick m walls the original plans called for it to be built of stone however was used instead the arkansas referred to the structure as a specimen of civil war for several years the arsenal which was owned by the federal government served as a arms and was with only a of soldiers but in november with the american civil war on the a company of the second united states artillery consisting of five men was transferred to little rock under the command of captain james on january the state decided to hold a to if a state should be held to the issue of and to to such a it was planned for february however events at the arsenal would not on january then governor henry captain that he and his soldiers would be permitted to remain in the of the federal officers until the state by authority of the people have determined to their connection with the general government responded to this by the governor that his came from the united states government and began a but ultimately of and for although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming the first to between little rock and had recently been completed local john was asked to the first from arkansas s capital in his reported rumors that more federal troops had been sent to the little rock arsenal the united states troops at the of the western of the state and in the indian nation have all been recalled from winter to the at fort smith the at fort smith had been previously transferred to the united states arsenal in this city little rock the arsenal is one of the of military stores in the united states and is to be the of the ordered from the john january the was intended simply as a piece of news but lines quickly spread the news throughout the state the was interpreted by some as a call from the governor to to help the federal troops from the arsenal by february six units consisting of men with a that the numbers could be increased to if the deemed it necessary had assembled in little rock governor denied the troops to or giving any order at all in connection with the troops faced with the fact that the military had assembled they were following his and the of the citizens of little rock against any armed conflict between the army and federal troops governor was forced to take control of the situation on february he sent a formal demand for of the arsenal to captain this movement is by the that the citizens of this state that in the present the arms and of war in the arsenal should be under the control of the state authorities in order to their security this movement although not by me has assumed such an that it becomes my duty as the executive of this to my official authority to prevent a between the people of the state and the federal troops under your command therefore demand in the name of the state the of the of the arsenal and of war under your charge to the state authorities to be held subject to the action of the to be held on the th of march next perhaps because had not yet been as president captain received no from his and was forced to his troops he agreed to the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three the governor would take of the arsenal in the name of the united states the soldiers would be allowed passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property of war the soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under not as and soldiers on the morning of february and signed an the arsenal in the hands of state officials that the to the arsenal with governor at its head all of the federal troops had left at this point except who had behind to to the governor s and to hand the arsenal over in person the little rock arsenal was in as an arsenal of meaning that it was simply a for the of weapons intended for the use of the state in times of thus there were no operations for ordnance or nor for the of at the time the arsenal fell into state hands most of these operations were started from through the efforts of the arkansas military board inside the little rock arsenal after its in february the some weapons and percussion as well as the four of s battery long arms in the arsenal s consisted of m m percussion converted m percussion m rifle m common rifles m rifle rifle m hall s hall s rifles total of this number approximately weapons were or for issue note there were only percussion weapons available of the weapons found in the arsenal is somewhat but from various records it can be that the th th th and th arkansas infantry in june were issued m m caliber the th and th arkansas four companies of s th arkansas and the rd arkansas were issued hall s rifles the units the infantry force of van s army of the west were the st and nd arkansas mounted rifles were also armed with m from the little rock arsenal by the time the th and th arkansas infantry in at little rock the supply of arms had been almost completely and only old weapons were left most of the equipment arms and at the little rock arsenal was removed to east of the river by order of van in april and may and for it is lost at that point by all appearances the equipment was sent down the river to arkansas and from there to jackson where it was probably destroyed during the campaign in the early summer of major general thomas sent to command the district of arkansas in may found the state nearly of military material established another at and the little rock arsenal as a collection point and for and ammunition for small arms recorded was made for percussion and small arms and both were turned out in small but of quality lead were opened and worked and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the ordnance department and in the of oil of the various of iron and other valuable most of these works were located at or near on the river miles south from little rock the and the material were or else made by hand labor nothing of this had been before attempted on government account in arkansas to my knowledge except for the of small arms the for which was taken away by general van and there was neither capital nor among the citizens to in such a further supply along with lead and was from the citizens of little rock and by and this ammunition and that which brought with me was rapidly prepared for use at the laboratory established at the little rock arsenal for that purpose as as the of material in the country the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public of the state library for paper were employed or purchased or and the of the damaged guns brought with me and about an number found at little rock at once but after the work and the of the men decided that a strong could hold out against and that would lead the remainder about to as soon as and rifles could be obtained from little rock instead of and with which most of them were armed two days before the change could be the confederate ordnance establishment at little rock was in august looking around for a suitable person to head this activity general turned to the confederate navy and lieutenant john w was the commander of the which had been brought to little rock in of it to an was selected to head the ordnance works at little rock and although he continued to draw his pay from the confederate navy department he was placed in charge of all confederate ordnance activities which included artillery there with the of lieutenant s for the month of august at little rock arsenal are found in vol chapter of the captured ordnance records and are most as to the scope of confederate ordnance activities at little rock during this time according to when assumed command at this post all material had been removed to there were no persons employed no were open for of arms or for ammunition material had to be as well as the of work the last part of the month the military force at little rock under s command consisted of four officers himself major john b captain green and nd in addition to these he had enlisted men and a force composed of a for small arms a in the ammunition laboratory and a for making during the month of august the following work was performed one pair of ball shot repaired and rifles received and repaired ordnance stores and performed guard office and police duties at and continued to build up his works at little rock until november when captain sanford of the arkansas was placed in charge of the arsenal returned to his naval duties and the a of the work done for november little rock arsenal shows ball percussion ball paper shot ball shot ammunition repaired and rifles repaired mostly for troops in service repaired mostly for troops in service received issued of ordnance and ordnance stores received and mostly issued to troops in service repaired and painted gun performed guard office and police duties perhaps the most points of the above of work and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was ball that the caliber and remained the caliber in use and of this nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for weapons that no less than a sixth of the confederate troops in this were still armed with weapons the of work done at little rock arsenal continue at about the same and scale from august until august to the for august is the during the last week in the month nearly all stores at the arsenal have been and sent to in to from chief of ordnance district of arkansas this then the beginning of the of ordnance activities from little rock with

egyptian deities ancient egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses in ancient egypt the beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient egyptian religion which emerged in deities represented natural forces and and the egyptians supported and them through and rituals so that these forces would continue to according to maat or divine order after the of the egyptian state around bc the authority to perform these was controlled by the who claimed to be the gods representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out the gods complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in relationships between deities family loose groups and and of separate gods into one deities appearances in art — as animals humans objects and of different forms — also through to their essential features in different various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society including the deity ra the god amun and the mother goddess isis the highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life giving power of the sun some scholars have argued based in part on egyptian writings that the egyptians came to a single divine power that behind all things and was present in all the other deities yet they never abandoned their original view of the world except during the era of in the th century bc when official religion on the sun god gods were assumed to be present throughout the world capable of natural events and the course of human lives people with them in temples and shrines for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state egyptians for divine help used rituals to deities to act and called upon them for humans with their gods were a part of egyptian society definition the beings in ancient egyptian tradition who might be as deities are difficult to count egyptian texts list the names of many deities whose nature is unknown and make to other gods who are not even named the james p that more than deities are named in egyptian texts whereas his christian says there are upon of gods the egyptian language s terms for these beings were god and its form goddess scholars have tried to the original nature of the gods by for these words but of these has gained and the terms remains the that were used as and in writing these words show some of the that the egyptians connected with the most common of these signs is a flying from a similar objects were placed at the of temples representing the presence of a deity throughout ancient egyptian history other such include a of several early gods who were depicted as and a seated male or female deity the form could also be written with an as goddesses with creation and birth or with a the use of the to many female deities the egyptians distinguished gods from people but the of the egyptian and the english terms do not match the term may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the of life humans were called because they were considered to be like the gods whereas the term was rarely applied to many of egypt s beings which modern scholars often call demons egyptian religious art also depicts places objects and in human form these ideas range from deities that were important in myth and to beings only mentioned once or twice that may be little more than these between gods and other beings scholars have proposed various of a deity one widely accepted definition suggested by jan says that a deity has a cult is involved in some of the universe and is described in or other forms of written tradition according to a different definition by applied to any being that was the focus of from this gods included the king who was called a god after his and who entered the divine through the of the great gods was maintained by the that was performed for them across egypt the first written evidence of deities in egypt comes from the early period c – bc deities must have emerged in the period before bc and grown out of religious beliefs depicts a variety of animal and human figures some of these images such as stars and are of important features of egyptian religion in later times but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities as egyptian society grew more signs of religious activity appeared the earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the era along with images that resemble the of known deities the that represents horus and several other gods the that for and the set animal that represents set many and have suggested about how the gods developed in these early times for instance thought the egyptians first then deities in animal form and finally deities in human form whereas argued that the gods must have been in human form from the beginning some of these are now regarded as too and more current ones such as that deities emerged as humans began to themselves from and their environment are difficult to egypt originally consisted of small independent because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular and regions many scholars have suggested that the formed as communities into larger states and the worship of the old local deities but others have argued that the most important gods were like other elements of egyptian culture present all across the country despite the political within it the final step in the formation of egyptian religion was the of egypt in which rulers from upper egypt made themselves of the entire country these sacred kings and their assumed the right to with the gods and became the focus of the religion new gods continued to after this some important deities like isis and amun are not known to have appeared until the old kingdom c – bc places and could the creation of a deity to represent them and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite sex to established gods or goddesses kings were said to be divine although only a few continued to be long after their deaths some non royal humans were said to have the of the gods and were this was usually short lived but the court and son of were regarded as gods centuries after their as were some other officials through contact with the egyptians also adopted foreign deities who is first mentioned in the old kingdom may have come from and and among others were adopted from religion during the new kingdom c – bc in greek and roman times from bc to the early centuries ad deities from across the world were in egypt but the native gods remained and they often the of these into their own worship characteristics modern knowledge of egyptian beliefs about the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation s and these people were the of egyptian society and were very distinct from the general most of whom were little is known about how well this population knew or the ideas that the developed of the divine may have from those of the the may for example have the religion s about the gods and their actions for but overall what little is known about popular religious belief is with the tradition the two form a largely of the gods and their nature roles most egyptian deities represent natural or social the gods were generally said to be in these — to be present within nature the types of they represented include physical places and objects as well as and forces the god was the of all the world s air the goddess a limited region of the earth the and the god the of major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of for instance was the god of island in the of the the river that was essential to egyptian he was credited with producing the annual that the nation s perhaps as an of this life giving he was said to create all living things their bodies on a s gods could share the same role in nature ra horus and other deities as sun gods despite their most gods had an role in common maat the universal order that was a central of egyptian religion and was itself as a goddess but some deities represented to maat most was the force of chaos constantly to the order of the universe and set was an member of divine society who could both fight and it not all aspects of existence were seen as deities although many deities were connected with the no god it in the way that ra the sun short lived like or were not represented by gods neither were elements like fire and water or many other of the world the roles of each deity were and each god could its nature to take on new characteristics as a result gods roles are difficult to or but despite their the gods had limited and of influence not even the creator god could reach beyond the of the that he created and even isis though she was said to be the of the gods was not richard h however that some texts from the late new kingdom that as beliefs about the god amun he was thought to approach and and to the of the world in a way that other deities did not the deities with the most limited and are often called minor or demons in modern writing although there is no definition for these terms among these deities a between — patron of certain places objects or activities such as the sea or marsh god and the goddess — and demons who have a more character many demons are causing and other among humans their power can also be they may guard certain places in the the of the dead or and over humans egyptians believed the was full of these divine powers demons often act as and to the greater gods but their position in the is not fixed

divine order the gods actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things they did this work using a force the egyptians called a term usually as magic was a power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves the gods actions in the present are described and praised in and texts in contrast mainly the gods actions during a past in which the gods were present on earth and directly with humans the events of this past time set the pattern for the events of the present were tied to events in the past the of each new for instance horus to the of his father

to understanding the gods in myth the gods much like humans they feel they can fight and some have unique character set is aggressive and and patron of writing and knowledge is to long yet overall the gods are more like than well drawn characters their behavior is and their and are rarely stated most myths about them lack highly developed characters and because the meaning of the myths was more important than the first divine act is the creation of the described in several creation myths they focus on different gods each of which may act as creator deities the eight gods of the who represent the chaos that creation give birth to the sun god who order in the newly formed world who thought and gives form to all things by and them produces all things as of himself and amun according to the myths promoted by his and created the other creator gods these and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as each gives a different on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from chaos the period following creation in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society is the setting for most myths the gods against the forces of chaos and among each other before from the human world and the historical kings of egypt to rule in their place a theme in these myths is the effort of the gods to maat against the forces of they fight with the forces of chaos at the start of creation ra and each other each night continue this into the present another prominent theme is the gods death and revival the instance where a god dies is the myth of osiris murder in which that god is as ruler of the the sun god is also said to old during his daily across the sky into the at night and as a young child at in the process he comes into contact with the water of chaos texts that ra s through the also show the of gods who are along with him instead of being the gods died and were by the events of creation thus the whole world but it was always possible for this to be and for chaos to return some egyptian texts even that this is to — that the creator god will one day the order of the world leaving only himself and osiris the chaos gods were with specific regions of the universe in egyptian tradition the world includes the earth the sky and the surrounding them is the dark that before creation the gods in general were said to in the sky although gods whose roles were with other parts of the universe were said to live in those places instead most events of set in a time before the gods from the human take place in an setting the deities there sometimes with those in the sky the in contrast is treated as a and place and the gods who there have difficulty with those in the world of the living the space outside the is also said to be very it too is by deities some and some to the other gods and their world in the time after myth most gods were said to be either in the sky or present within the world temples were their main means of contact with each day it was believed the gods moved from the divine to their temples their homes in the human world there they the cult images the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to with them in temple rituals this movement between was sometimes described as a between the sky and the earth as temples were the points of egyptian cities the god in a city s main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region deities of influence on earth on the and regions they over many gods had more than one cult center and their local changed over time they could establish themselves in new cities or their range of influence could contract therefore a given deity s main cult center in historical times is not his or her place of the political influence of a city could the importance of its patron deity when kings from took control of the country at start of the middle kingdom c – bc they patron gods — first the war god and then amun — to national names and in egyptian belief names the nature of the things to which they refer in with this belief the names of deities often to their roles or the name of the goddess means powerful one the name of the god amun means one and the name of the goddess who was in the city of means she of but many other names have no certain meaning even when the gods who them are closely tied to a single role the names of the sky goddess and the earth god do not resemble the egyptian terms for sky and earth the egyptians also false giving more to divine names a passage in the texts the name of the god as r meaning of the mouth to link his name with his role in the opening of the mouth while one in the texts says the name is based on words by osiris with the most important deity the gods were believed to have many names among them were secret names that their true more than others to know the true name of a deity was to have power over it the importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which isis the god ra and to cure him unless he his secret name to her upon the name she it to her son horus and by it they greater knowledge and power in addition to their names gods were given like of ruler of or lord of the sky that describe some of their roles or their worship because of the gods multiple and roles deities can have many — with more important gods more titles — and the same can to many deities some eventually became separate deities as with an applied to several goddesses meaning great which came to be treated as an independent goddess the host of divine names and titles the gods nature relationships egyptian deities are connected in a complex and of relationships a god s and with other deities helped its character thus isis as the mother and of horus was a great as well as the of kings such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed family relationships are a common type of connection between gods deities often form male and female the importance of in egyptian religious thought families of three deities with a father mother and child represent the creation of new life and the of the father by the child a pattern that divine families with royal osiris isis and horus formed the family of this type the pattern they set grew more widespread over time so that many deities in local cult like and their child at and amun and at were assembled into family like these are in with the multiple in egyptian belief as a goddess could act as mother to any child god including the child form of the sun god although in other circumstances she was the sun god s daughter other divine groups were composed of deities with roles or who together represented a region of the egyptian there were of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each province of egypt some of these groups a specific important number of deities gods can for opposite but that are part of a greater ra who is and light producing and osiris who is and in into a single god each night groups of three are with in ancient egyptian thought and groups of four rulers in the late new kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others amun ra and these deities for the of all gods as well as for their own cult the major cities of and and for many of in egyptian religious thought sometimes set the patron god of the kings and the of within the world was added to this group which a single of the nine the of three and three represents a so the egyptians called several large groups or of nine even if they had more than nine members the most prominent was the of an extended family of deities from the creator god which many important gods the term was often extended to include all of egypt s deities this divine had a and gods with broad influence in the or who were older than others had higher positions in divine society at the of this society was the king of the gods who was usually identified with the creator deity in different periods of egyptian history different gods were most frequently said to hold this position horus was the most important god in the early period ra rose to in the old kingdom amun was in the new and in the and roman periods isis was the divine queen and creator goddess newly prominent gods to characteristics from their isis the of many other goddesses during her rise and when amun became the ruler of the he was with ra the traditional king of the gods to become a deity and the gods were believed to in many forms the egyptians had complex of the human soul consisting of several parts the of the gods were composed of many of these same elements the was the of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it any of a god s power could be called its thus the sun was called the of ra a of a deity was considered a another of its being which as a vessel for that deity s to the cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities were believed to house divine in this way gods could be many and which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god s nature everything in existence was said to be one of the of the creator god who originally contained all things within himself and one deity could be called the of another meaning that the first god is a of the other s power divine body parts could act as separate deities like the eye of ra and hand of both of which were as goddesses important deities gave rise to local which sometimes the characteristics of older regional gods horus had many forms tied to particular places including horus of horus of and horus of such local could be treated almost as separate beings during the new kingdom one man was accused of by an to from amun of he two other local of amun for a different gods also according to their roles horus could be a powerful sky god or child and these forms were sometimes as independent deities gods were combined with each other as as they were divided a god could be called the of another or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and local gods were with greater ones and deities with similar were combined ra was connected with the local deity to form ra with his fellow god amun to form amun ra with the form of horus to form ra and with several deities as ra on rare even deities of different were joined in this way producing like osiris and this of deities is called unlike other for which this term is used the egyptian practice was not meant to belief systems although foreign deities could be with native ones instead the between their roles and extended the of influence for each of them were not permanent a god who was involved in one continued to appear and to form new with other deities but closely connected deities did sometimes horus several gods from various regions such as and who became little more than local of him a similar goddess and an early god was by osiris and the and possible in the reign of c – bc in the mid new kingdom a single deity the became the focus of the state religion to the temples of other deities and the gods names and images on monuments amun in particular this new religious system sometimes called from the worship of many gods in all other periods whereas in earlier times newly important gods were into existing religious beliefs on a single understanding of the divine that the traditional of yet may not have been full which belief in other deities there is evidence suggesting that the general was still allowed to worship other gods in private the picture is further by s for some other deities like for these reasons the suggested that may have been a single deity while the existence of others in any case s did not take among the egyptian and s returned to traditional beliefs of the divine in traditional religion scholars have long whether traditional egyptian religion ever asserted that the multiple gods were on a level reasons for this debate include the practice of which might that all the separate gods could ultimately into one and the of egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that all other deities another point of is the appearance of the word god in literature where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities in the early th century for instance e a believed that egyptian were but knowledge of the true nature of the religion was for the who wrote the literature his contemporary james henry thought egyptian religion was instead with the power of the sun god present in all other gods while argued that egyptian had been originally and became in the course of its history in published a study these views he points out that in any given period many deities even minor ones were described as to all others he also that the god in the texts is a term for deity the to although the and of each god were constantly they were always to a number of forms never becoming fully in a or way says describes egyptian religion better than other an egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with power in that moment without the other gods or them all with the god that he or she on that the gods were fully only in myth at the time before creation after which the of gods emerged from a s have greatly influenced other scholars of egyptian religion but some still believe that at times the gods were more than he jan that the of a single deity developed through the new kingdom beginning with a focus on amun ra as the all important sun god in his view was an extreme of this it the single deity with the sun and all other gods then in the against described the universal god in a different way one that with traditional the one god was believed to the world and all the other deities while at the same time the multiple gods were aspects of the one according to this one god was especially with amun the god in the late new kingdom whereas for the rest of egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods james p says that of one god and many gods would fit well with the of in egyptian thought as well as with the practice of he says that the egyptians may have recognized the of the divine by their of god with a particular god on the particular situation and egyptian writings describe the gods bodies in they are made of materials their flesh is gold their bones are silver and their hair is they give off a that the egyptians to the used in rituals some texts give of particular deities including their height and eye color yet these characteristics are not fixed in myths gods change their appearances to their own purposes egyptian texts often refer to deities true forms as the egyptians visual of their gods are therefore not they specific aspects of each deity s character much like the in writing for this reason the god is commonly shown in egyptian art as a dog or a whose the of buried in an effort to this threat and it for protection his black to the color of flesh and to the black soil that egyptians saw as a of most gods were depicted in several ways could be a or a woman with or by depicting a given god in different ways the egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature the gods are depicted in a number of these forms so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their these forms include men and women animals and more rarely objects of forms such as gods with human bodies and animal heads are common new forms and increasingly complex in the course of history some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are in writing as with isis and because of the close connection between these goddesses they could both the that was originally s alone certain features of divine images are more than others in a god s identity the head of a given divine image is particularly significant in a image the head represents the original form of the being depicted so that as the henry put it a headed goddess is a goddess in human form while a royal is a man who has assumed the form of a divine which range from the same types of used by human kings to large on gods heads are another important in contrast the objects held in gods hands tend to be male deities hold was goddesses hold of and both signs representing the egyptian word for life to their life giving power the forms in which the gods are shown although are limited in many ways many that are widespread in egypt were never used in divine whereas a few such as and can each represent many deities animals that were from egypt in the early of its history were not used as divine images for instance the which was only introduced in the second intermediate period c – bc never represented a god similarly the by deities in all periods changed little from the styles used in the old kingdom a false and often a for male gods and a long for goddesses the basic form child gods are depicted as are some adult gods when their powers are certain male deities are given heavy and either or and whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow — the same used to egyptian men and women — some are given unusual skin thus the blue skin and figure of the god to the he represents and the it brought a few deities such as osiris and have a appearance with their in although these gods resemble the earliest examples the wrapped style of and this form may instead back to the earliest of deities with humans relationship with the in official writings are said to be divine and they are constantly depicted in the company of the deities of the each and his were considered the of the gods who had egypt in living kings were with horus and called the son of many deities particularly osiris and ra kings were with these gods had their own temples where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths but few were as gods long after their and non official texts kings in a human light for these reasons scholars about how most egyptians believed the king to be a god he may only have been considered divine when he was performing however much it was believed the king s divine status was the for his role as egypt s representative to the gods as he formed a link between the divine and human the egyptians believed the gods needed temples to in as well as the performance of rituals and of to them these things were provided by the that the king with their and yet according to royal temple building was the s work as were the rituals that usually performed in his these acts were a part of the king s role maat the king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their which maintained maat in the so humans could continue to live presence in the human world although the egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them contact between the human and divine was mostly limited to specific circumstances in literature gods may appear to humans in a physical form but in real life the egyptians were limited to more means of the of a god was said to leave the divine to in the images of that god by these images the gods left their state and took on a physical form to the egyptians a place or that was — sacred — was isolated and and thus fit for a god to temple statues and as well as particular sacred animals like the served as divine in this way and provided a very different for interaction in these states it was believed people could come close to the gods and sometimes from them finally according to egyptian beliefs human pass into the divine after death the egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully their nature temples where the state rituals were carried out were with images of the gods the most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner these statues were usually less than life size and made of the same materials that were said to form the gods bodies many temples had several each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family the city s primary god was as its lord many of the residents as in the divine that the temple represented the gods in the temples of egypt represented the entire but many deities — including some important gods as well as those that were minor or — were never given temples of their own although some were represented in the temples of other gods to the sacred power in the from the of the outside world the egyptians temple and greatly access to them people other than kings and high were thus denied contact with cult statues the only was during festival when the statue was carried out of the temple but still in a shrine people did have less direct means of interaction the more public parts of temples often small places for from to near the back of the temple building communities also built and managed small for their own use and some families had shrines inside their homes despite the gulf that from the divine the egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods in human lives egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the order of nature this divine influence applied mainly to egypt as foreign were believed to be outside the divine order but in the new kingdom when other nations were under egyptian control were said to be under the sun god s rule in the same way that egyptians were as the of time was said to fixed to both humans and gods other gods were also said to the length of human lives including who over birth and the of fate thus the time and of death was the main meaning of the egyptian concept of fate although to some these deities other events in life as well several texts refer to gods or human decisions working through a person s heart — the seat of and in egyptian belief deities were also believed to give the king in the of his and the management of their temples egyptian texts rarely direct given to private persons and these never into a set of moral in ancient egypt was based on the concept of maat which when applied to human society meant that should live in an way that did not with the well being of other people because deities were the of maat was connected with them for example the gods humans moral after death and by the new kingdom a of in this was believed to be necessary for into the but in general was based on ways to maat in daily life rather than on rules that the gods laid out humans had free will to divine and the behavior required by maat but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves a deity carried out this punishment using its the force that the god s power in the human world natural and human were seen as the work of divine the gods could cure people of or even their both these types of were eventually represented by deities who emerged in the new kingdom to represent divine from and an god from the late of egyptian history who was believed to egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans was often seen as a of the that was the opposite of maat and therefore the gods were not of causing evil events some deities who were closely connected with such as set could be for within the world without on the other gods but some writings do the deities of causing human while others give in the gods defense beginning in the middle kingdom several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god a human against his rule and then from the earth because of this human the creator is from his creation allowing suffering to exist new kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the middle kingdom they humans direct personal relationships with deities and the gods power to in human events people in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives as a result the of maat grew less important than the gods as a way to a good life even the were regarded as on divine aid and after the new kingdom came to an end government was increasingly influenced by the gods will worship official religious practices which maintained maat for the benefit of all egypt were related to but distinct from the religious practices of people who sought the gods help for their personal problems official religion involved a variety of rituals based in temples some were performed every day whereas others were taking place at longer and often limited to a particular temple or deity the gods received their in daily in which their statues were and presented with food as were in their honor these in addition to maat for the gods deities life giving and them to remain rather than often involved a in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a shaped shrine these served various purposes in roman times when local deities of all were believed to have power over the in many communities carried temple images to the so the gods could a large and also between temples as when the image of from temple visited her horus at the temple of rituals for a god were often based in that deity s such rituals were meant to be of the events of the past the effects of the original events in the festival in honor of osiris his death and were at a time when were beginning to the returning the of the god s own life personal interaction with the gods took many forms people who wanted information or run by temples that were to gods to and other images of deities were used to off the demons that might human well being or to the god s positive characteristics to the private rituals the gods power to personal goals from to enemies these practices used the same force of magic that the gods used which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could off the of a private often took on the role of a god in a myth or even threatened a deity to the gods in the goal such rituals with private and and all three were accepted means of divine help and private are generally called personal acts that a close relationship between an individual and a god evidence of personal is before the new kingdom and personal names many of which are that felt some connection between themselves and their gods but evidence of to deities became only in the new kingdom reaching a late in that era scholars about the meaning of this change — whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an of older egyptians now expressed their through a new variety of activities in and around temples they recorded their and their for divine help on they gave of that represented the gods they were to or that the result they thus a relief image of and a of a woman could both represent a for occasionally a person took a particular god as a patron his or her property or labor to the god s cult these practices continued into the periods of egyptian history these later saw more religious including the practice of giving animal as to deities depicted in animal form such as the cat given to the goddess some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely in popular worship but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition the worship of some egyptian gods spread to especially to and during the new kingdom when those regions were under control in the deities including amun and set were often with native gods who in turn spread to egypt the egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in and their importance there after egypt lost control of the region in contrast many temples to the major egyptian gods and were built in after the end of egyptian rule there the gods particularly amun and isis were with local deities and remained part of the religion of s independent kingdom of these gods were into the of much as they were in egypt so that amun was considered the divine father of the king and isis and other goddesses were with the queen the some deities reached became a goddess in and amun s at was known to and by people across the region under the greek and then roman rule and introduced their own deities to egypt these the egyptian gods with their own as part of the roman tradition of but the worship of the native gods was not up by that of foreign ones instead greek and roman gods were adopted as of egyptian ones egyptian sometimes greek language and even temple architecture meanwhile the of several egyptian deities — particularly isis osiris the form of horus named and the egyptian god — were adopted into roman religion and spread across the roman empire roman like kings before them isis and to their authority inside and outside egypt in the empire s complex mix of religious was into the and isis who was from britain to became the focus of a greek style cult isis and were both prominent in the western tradition that grew from the roman religious world temples and in egypt itself declined as the roman economy in the third century ad and beginning in the fourth century the of egyptian deities the last formal at died out in the fifth or sixth century most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves within a few years remaining in texts into the seventh and eighth centuries but many of the practices involved in their worship such as and were adapted to fit christian and as part of the church given the great changes and influences in egyptian culture since that time scholars about whether any modern practices are from those of religion but many and other of modern egyptians both christian and resemble the worship of their gods south of heaven south of heaven is the fourth studio album by american metal band slayer released on july the album was the band s second collaboration with record producer rick whose production skills on slayer s previous album reign in blood had helped the band s sound south of heaven was slayer s second album to the billboard and its last to be released by although the album became an american album after rick ended his with it was one of only two titles to be by records through records because of original columbia records to release work by the band the release peaked at number and in was awarded a gold by the recording industry association of america in order to the of the group s previous album slayer down the album s in contrast to their previous albums the band and down vocals while some critics praised this musical change others — more to the style of earlier releases — were the songs mandatory suicide and the title track however have become permanent features of the band s live background south of heaven was recorded in los angeles with reign in blood producer rick observed that s production s right up front in the mix jeff has since said that south of heaven was the only album the band members before writing the music that they t top reign in blood and that they recorded would be compared to that album he believed they had to slow down something slayer had never done on albums before or since king cited the need to keep people as another reason for the musical in order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on reign in blood slayer down the of the album as a whole according to slayer s official they also added elements like and down vocal styles not heard on previous albums king has since been critical of his performance which he describes as his most king this to the fact he had recently married and moved to phoenix describing himself as probably the man out at that point he admitted he didn ’ t as much because of that said we go through dry sometimes but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never go without at that time was a dry king has also been critical of the album in general describing it as one of his least favorite slayer albums he moved too far away from his regular vocal style and added too much has since observed there was fire on all the records but it started when south of heaven came into the picture and that s me again was probably something else s is the only cover version to appear on a slayer studio album the song was due to its war themed lyrics described the track as more just like one of those songs that a lot of people didn t know but it was a favorite of and so we just picked that one meanwhile the soul has been heavily criticized by king who said that he the track that s one of the black in our history in my book just think it s the opening it s what we call a happy it s just like la la la la can t see playing it but after that where it like that section if we ever did a d put part of that in there the slayer soundtrack to the featured along with four songs

their most and on this set its five show how highly the band of the record s peter was also positive saying the album has a and presence which makes the record so grave s and s karl both rate south of heaven as the top five albums of all time while max of death metal group the song for the first time it just me away it was like double bass during the whole song that was very for me when slayer in an october interview stated that while reign in blood was just speed south of heaven proved that the group could write slow material as well metal forces gives the band credit for at least making an effort to something new and not being to at such a stage of their career creating one of the more original speed metal albums he heard in a long while he however that if you ’ re to reign in blood part two you ’ be in for a major of stone the album as offensive slayer s official states the new some of the band s fans who were more to the style of earlier releases michael of said this was due to some of the numbers moving at the speed of black commented that the album was a late — it wasn t really received well but it kind of grew on later cover versions the title track and the song mandatory

industry which is around per cent the size of its cat people and £ billion to the uk economy ga is by the civil aviation authority caa although powers are being increasingly transferred to the european aviation safety agency easa the main focus is on standards of and pilot and the is to promote high standards of safety at the end of the ga some authority is to representative bodies and gliding is in from a self model to more formal by easa airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of cat operations has reduced the area in which ga flights can be conducted the growth in cat is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the ga sector and smaller aerodromes are to and re development for more uses the uk planning system has no to the national significance of ga public transport operations and generally does not the development of smaller aerodromes to the ga market the planning process has become a for local aerodrome related environmental issues which particularly regarding noise are the main of public criticism at ga the international civil aviation organization general aviation ga as an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation it commercial air transport cat as an aircraft operation involving the transport of cargo or for or and aerial work as an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for services such as construction and search and aerial in the united kingdom uk describe ga in less terms that include elements of commercial aviation the british business and general aviation association it to be all and flying except that performed by the major and the armed services the general aviation council the description all civil aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non scheduled air transport operations for or for the purposes of a review of ga in the uk the civil aviation authority caa the scope of ga as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a and considered it necessary to from the definition and include aerial work and minor cat operations history the first aerodrome in the uk was established by the club at on the of and in may it was the of the first flight conducted in the country by a british pilot john moore in the club was granted the royal took responsibility for all private flying in the uk and started the first british pilot the of the de in light aviation and the royal club the of civil flying formed the light club between and around flying were started and more than pilots were during world war civil aerodromes were taken over for military use existing military airfields were expanded and new ones were built this resulted in a significant of facilities becoming available after the war pre war civil aerodromes for example were returned to use military airfields were closed and in some cases for example subsequently re opened as civil aerodromes the ministry of civil aviation was created to all civil aviation in the uk and this remained the responsibility of government until the establishment of the independent caa in with an expanded in place ga became established after the war when such as and introduced light aircraft designed for the private market the developed from the late s was introduced in and became the world s best selling single engine single engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the uk ga fleet the development of the wing in the s the development of gliding during the s and s the s also saw with gliders but it was not until the s that this of started to resulting in the birth of the movement another in the development of ga was the of the although it was not the first business it aviation and established the personal as a whole new class of aircraft activities the ga sector operates a range of aircraft including and gliders gliders amateur built and mass produced light aircraft military aircraft and business flights can be as public transport aerial work and private flying the first two of which are commercial activities commercial operations commercial operations are activities which fall within the definition of cat some are however closely to and considered part of the ga sector public transport operations are non scheduled on demand services flying between points by the a more service than air operations offer services for third parties and business or aviation uses company owned aircraft to transport and aircraft used in these operations include business and twin engine carrying between six and ten people an example of this type of operation is the transport by of to the british one grand at this so many flights that according to aviation services on race day the is the world s airport aerial work is a small but important of the commercial ga sector in its form as non transport activities such as and services work air and police flying schools flying schools are commercial engaged in the training of pilots both for recreational purposes and for those to fly they make widespread use of fixed wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga not only for flying but also as club aircraft out to pilots for recreational flights school owned aircraft account for a significant amount of ga activity both in terms of hours and aircraft the pilot training element is regarded by the ga community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the industry it is claimed by the general aviation council that – per cent of professional pilots have self their flight training at ga schools and one uk has stated that the industry must on – per cent of new pilots coming from the ga sector the caa that between and the number of new professional pilots following the training route rose from per cent to per cent the to this claim is that pilots can be outside of the uk and that the industry is not therefore on a ga sector in the uk for its supply of pilots the caa that a severe in ga would give some to the that pilot would be threatened but that the data on flying hours does not support such a of course on other countries for pilot training means that the uk the economic benefit of the training activity private flying private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport using aircraft that are owned as part of a or from a flying club a survey of pilots conducted between and indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome to other aerodromes and day away half of all flights at the same aerodrome they from and only per cent involved an stay away from home private flying is most associated with the traditional form of factory produced two and four single engine training and touring aircraft examples of these are the and all with their in the s and the more modern of the average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £ compared to an estimated £ per hour for gliders and a reported £ per hour for recent have seen an increase in the use of and also in recreational flying following the of smaller and such as the r and r another growth area in private flying in recent years has been in the use of amateur built aircraft such as the van s aircraft and the there is a strong aircraft movement in the uk with two of the historic aircraft active these cover the whole of civil and military aviation examples being the de of the s and the world war there are many post aircraft which could also be considered historic under a definition including for example military such as the hunter historic aircraft are regular at air which are claimed to be the second most popular activity

aerodromes aerodrome is a term for any location from which flying operations take place although more specific can be used to its purpose the caa review of ga the term airport to which support large

size from regional airports to the farm although per cent of ga flights operate from of the larger aerodromes in the first four aerodrome classification the factors used in how an individual aerodrome is by the study are based on size and facilities the six types of aerodrome are described in size order as regional airports eg east major ga airports eg oxford developed ga airfields eg basic ga airfields eg developed eg and basic eg in the used to aerodromes were complex using different up with a review by experienced ga pilots airports generally have long fully hard full air traffic control

as developed ga airfields or larger by the study are with few only two basic ga airfields and are and all are the light aviation airports study group a joint caa industry was established in to review the regulation of light aviation aerodromes a particular focus of this group was a review of the placed on aerodromes the group concluded that the for public transport operations to be conducted only from aerodromes should be further reviewed in the context of international and european it also recommended that on flight training at aerodromes should be and this was permitted from april scale of

or an transport pilot licence although not all of these would be engaged in ga activities in addition there are active glider pilots and put the of aviation related and recreational at the number of aerodromes that support ga in the uk is difficult to establish with united kingdom flight and the flight equipment uk flight nearly farm and private airfields flight more than landing sites the study formal flying sites in england alone a figure which includes sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight it another sites known only to land and members of the group air britain the sector was estimated to nearly people and directly £ billion to the uk economy in making it roughly seven per cent of the size of the cat industry nearly half of the economic was by business aviation most of ga for which data are available have experienced growth in aircraft numbers and hours over the last two decades the end of the ga amateur built and and have in particular shown strong growth although the last of these activities was severely during the foot and mouth outbreak in when access to was denied after strong growth in the late s traditional flying has shown a decline recently a move recreational towards aircraft and increased numbers of foreign aircraft recreational has grown primarily due to the of smaller and aircraft glider activity has remained relatively although there has been a increase in the number of self gliders business aviation has shown strong growth although the numbers of aircraft on the uk register have declined this a away from aircraft towards foreign business based in the uk which are estimated to be growing in numbers however twin aircraft numbers have declined significantly on the light air from increasingly and scheduled services and a more business the amount of flight training conducted by uk schools has declined largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools which benefit from lower and better since the total number of hours by the ga sector has remained in the range – million the sector being traditional ga flying which accounts for million per year an overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with growth in hours has brought the annual average per aircraft down from hours in to hours in the decline in has led to that the economic health of the ga industry is though the lack of data on makes this difficult to regulation the of regulation is to promote high standards of safety in all aspects of aviation and this is the main area of interaction between the caa and the ga sector efforts focus on standards of pilot the rules for the movement of aircraft and equipment to be carried the caa was established as the primary body for all aviation in the uk in in it started working within the joint aviation authorities to agreed common standards known as the joint aviation throughout the european union in this was taken a step further when the european aviation safety agency easa was established as the central taking over responsibility for and environmental regulation from the national authorities the caa acts as an agency of easa on these issues its original powers in areas not yet transferred to easa proposed to establish easa as the single authority throughout the taking over from individual member states the power to all aviation other than that from the scope of easa and self regulation within this certain of ga are on a basis in all cases the caa easa responsibility for safety regulation but representative bodies particularly of that are not included in the scope of easa are granted greater of their activities the majority of aircraft are by the british aircraft association although a significant number are by the light aircraft association known as the popular flying association the is the primary for amateur built aircraft as well as and classic aircraft is by the british association although the aircraft used in this activity are generally caa and flying is by the british and club the uk specific national private pilot licence is by the national pilots group supported by the the aircraft and pilots association uk the british gliding association and the british aircraft association separate from these groups gliding in the uk is self the british gliding association was until recently responsible for glider now formally as a result of easa legislation and still control of pilot gliding and activities foot launched gliders are by the british gliding and association under caa and easa rules all aircraft are required to meet certain standards of to fly and aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a of however british aircraft which are from the scope of easa and which cannot the for the issue of a of may be issued with a to fly this them to fly in uk airspace subject to certain for example being to day time flights under visual flight rules only a number of eg the british aircraft association and the light aircraft association have obtained a standing over flight permission for to fly aircraft within their area of interest with some european countries notably france are typically issued to and historic aircraft amateur built aircraft and pilot the pilot most to ga is the private pilot licence which the to fly for recreational purposes without in addition to the european wide joint aviation flight crew standard the caa also issues uk specific national in the absence of european standards for and pilots the caa these according to the original uk standard as a response to the that pilot standards are and for the purposes of recreational pilots the national private pilot licence was introduced in the is to than the licence has less medical is more in the it and is valid only for flights in british aircraft flying in uk and french airspace although there are plans to bring glider pilot within the of easa the gliding sector is currently self in this respect the british gliding association is responsible for the standards of initial training and via a system pilots who meet those standards pilots working in of ga that are commercial operations such as aerial work and business aviation are required to hold a professional pilot licence which at a is the commercial pilot licence safety between and there were involving ga aircraft of which were resulting in the loss of lives the majority of involved small fixed wing aircraft engaged in private flights and analysis the most common of these to flight skills poor or lack of training or experience and of or action there were involving ga aircraft in resulting in the loss of lives these with claiming a total of lives the previous year and although the statistics are higher than average they are not issues the growth in commercial air transport cat has the freedom of ga both in the air and on the ground at larger airports difficulty with access to larger airports is by a decline in the number of aerodromes generally and existing sites are often threatened with and re development for more uses the uk planning system is designed to focus on local issues and of the national impact of ga operations is not within its this makes aerodrome development difficult often those that successfully the process to in use airspace access airspace is shared by cat military and ga it is divided into controlled airspace in which aircraft must always be under the control of an air traffic and airspace in which aircraft can operate although ga flights can under certain conditions controlled airspace they operate mainly outside of it controlled airspace is essential for the of a known air traffic environment necessary for the operation of cat a caa review found that commercial operations with other is considered even by commercial however this position has resulted in extensive class a controlled airspace with complex including some running down to the ground access to airspace resulting in high numbers of ga flights operating close to the of controlled airspace who could not get formal of an air traffic service with pilot of airspace have been recorded every year in the number of cat operations and in the number of airports they operate from has resulted in a increase in class a controlled airspace between and this area grew in size from per cent of all airspace to per cent and from per cent to per cent in airspace above england and wales leading to a within the ga community of being out there are particular problems for ga around large airports where class a controlled airspace to ground level the concentration of commercial operations and high demand for ga in the south east of england have also resulted in extensive areas of class a controlled airspace there which serve to channel ga operations through high risk hot aerodrome access regional airports such as airport have experienced strong growth in cat operations in recent years these operations are and with ga and although there is no evidence of the effect has been to or it ga aircraft are being subject to significant in charges including the of in some cases some airports or ga and others or certain ga activity as a result light ga aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large international airports such as and in addition to this de loss of facilities the number of aerodromes in the uk has been in decline over the last years as a result of increasing and the of airfields built during alternative and more uses for land can also lead to existing aerodromes being threatened with for example north or actually being closed as to airport and bristol airport to the importance of a national network of ga airfields especially where ga an air transport role the caa states that there could be cause for if a significant further loss of airfields were to continue especially if on the transport network were to be lost planning system the planning system is critical to the and operation of ga aerodromes with many cities scheduled air transport services between them and with ga access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and a network of aerodromes supporting ga air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue however there is no national planning policy specific to ga aerodromes and planning decisions to these are based on local issues that are not required to the national impact because aircraft are from noise control legislation the only for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process and this issue is the on which the majority of planning decisions to ga land use are made ga is a subject often to local planning authorities and most planning decisions to ga either permission or grant it with conditions little is just one example of a ga required to with planning on the number of permitted further development such if can make ga operations or even criticism public opinion towards aviation generally is based on increasing environmental to and noise and private flying has been criticised by to a government on aircraft noise as a or activity in terms of environmental and made to the caa that to ga noise is by far the most common subject half of the noise made to the caa ga operations most of which to using private sites air and alleged low flying planning on aircraft noise that in some circumstances the public general aircraft noise levels as more than similar levels around major airports this is a result of the characteristics of light aircraft and the activities they are engaged in including flying at low near an aerodrome during which aircraft are for long periods slow aircraft engaged in or glider activities around the zone or aerodrome also for long periods and engine noise from aircraft engaged in and on full power in areas of low background noise leading to the that such noise is more in an attempt to these problems the majority of aerodromes noise designed to route aircraft away from noise areas and more than are required by the government to provide facilities in which local can be raised with aerodrome sms zrínyi sms zrínyi his s ship zrínyi was a class pre battleship of the austro hungarian navy named for the a

a regular issue by the united states of the mint from to the coin had three types over its all designed by mint chief james b longacre the type issue had the diameter of any united states coin ever a gold dollar had been proposed several times in the s and s but was not initially adopted congress was finally into action by the increased supply of caused by the gold and in a gold dollar in its early years silver coins were being or and the gold dollar found a place in silver again after congress in required that new coins of that metal be made and the gold dollar became a in even before federal coins from circulation because of the economic caused by the american civil war gold did not again in most of the nation until once it did the gold dollar did not its place in its final years it was struck in small numbers causing by it was also in demand to be mounted in the regular issue gold dollar was last struck in the following year congress ended the series background in his plan for a mint and a system secretary of the treasury alexander in proposed that the one dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin and as one of silver representative of the two which he proposed be made legal congress followed s only in part a silver dollar but no coin of that denomination in gold in the first gold dollar was at the private mint of in north carolina much of the gold then being produced in the united states came from the of north carolina and georgia and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by through that region and were now and then seen further away additional one dollar pieces were struck by august s son soon after the began to strike their private issues secretary of the treasury became an of having the mint of the united states mint when described as an institution strike the one dollar denomination in gold he was opposed by the mint director robert patterson president andrew jackson to have pattern coins struck in response patterson had mint second christian break off work on the new design for the silver one dollar coin and work on a pattern for the gold dollar s design featured a surrounded by rays on one side and a branch arranged in a circle with the denomination date and name of the country on the other was given to including the gold dollar as an denomination in the legislation that became the mint act of the philadelphia newspaper public in december supported a gold dollar stating that the dollar is the gold coin that would be and as it would be so neither silver nor paper should be allowed to take its place nevertheless after mint director patterson appeared before a committee the the gold dollar was from the bill in january north carolina representative james mckay the chairman of the committee on ways and means the views of director patterson on the gold dollar patterson had more of s pattern dollar struck to show to committee members again against a coin that if issued would be only about a half inch mm in diameter he told treasury secretary john that the only gold coins of that size in the spanish and half were and had not been struck for more than twenty years this to the committee as nothing more was done for the time and when a gold dollar was proposed again in mckay s committee recommended against it even before record amounts of gold were to american to be struck into coin but the gold increased these this for a gold dollar as well as for a higher denomination than the piece then the largest gold coin in january mckay introduced a bill for a gold dollar which was referred to his committee there was much in the press about the proposed coin one newspaper published a for an gold dollar that is with a in the middle to increase its small diameter mckay his legislation to provide for a double gold coin and wrote to patterson who stating that the gold dollar would not work and neither would another to have dollar piece consisting of a gold in a silver coin nevertheless s successor as chief james b longacre prepared including some with a square in the middle mckay got his fellow new charles to the bill to the gold dollar and the double in the on february — was chairman of the committee mckay introduced a version into the house on february debate began the same day the dollar was attacked by from the party then in the on the grounds that it would be too small would be and in bad light might be spent as a half the coins being similar in size mckay did not but stated that if no one wanted these they would not be called for at the mint and would not be coined pennsylvania representative joseph a against the bill noting that patterson opposed the new and that the idea had been turned down considered another massachusetts s charles related that patterson had sent a real and a gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to the difference mckay made no to these claims but others did including new york henry who the house that the were greatly the point was he indicated that the double and gold dollar were wanted by the public and in the case of the gold dollar could help money in small communities where were not accepted representative john a a tried to table the bill but his was defeated the bill passed and met only in the becoming law on march the officers at the philadelphia mint including chief were mostly the friends and of director patterson the in their was chief james b longacre successor to who had died in a former longacre had been appointed through the political influence of south carolina john when longacre began work on the two new coins in early he had no one to him longacre wrote the following year that he had been by a mint that one of the officers planned to the chief s position by having the work of and dies done outside mint when the gold coin bill became law longacre patterson that he was to work on the gold dollar the mint director agreed and after a model of the head on the longacre to with of dies according to longacre the was minute and required very close and labor for several weeks made the original dies and for making the working dies twice over to their to the had a to this work single that might thus to those who had my ability for the work the result believe was original design the type gold dollar depicts a head of facing left with a or on her head her name her hair is in a she is surrounded by stars representing the original states the features the date and denomination within a with the name of the nation near the contemporary reviews of the type design were generally the new york on may described the new dollar as the coin in this country it is too and to pay out for and and might have paid with it for the which bank note list stated that there is no of them ever getting into general circulation they are too small the north carolina standard hoped that they would be struck at the charlotte mint and to eliminate the problem of small denomination bank notes from out of state coin and author david notes that the head of on the type dollar is a down version of that on the double and a preserved gold dollar is to mint records the first gold dollars were produced on may longacre s notes state instead that the first were struck on may a few coins in condition were struck on the first day along with about for circulation there are five major of the gold dollar from philadelphia made as longacre continued to the design dies were sent by longacre s department at the philadelphia mint to the branch at charlotte in georgia and new coins struck at the resemble some of the types issued from philadelphia on when the dies were produced of the coins struck at the branch in only pieces struck at charlotte exist in multiple most are of what is the closed variety approximately five of the open are known one believed the surviving specimen sold at for in remaining a record for the gold dollar series as of one of the changes made during production was the of longacre s initial on the of s neck the first time a us coin intended for full scale production had the initial of its all issues beginning in the closed beginning in the gold dollar was also struck at the new san francisco mint the continued flow of gold from made silver in terms of gold and us silver coins began to flow out of the country for in a flow that over the next several years as the of the metal continued to rise by a dollars in silver coin contained worth of as silver coins the gold dollar became the only federal coin in circulation between the cent and the quarter piece as such it was struck in large numbers and widely according to in his book on the denomination the years to were the high water mark of the gold dollar the years of the denomination when the little gold coins took the place of half dollars and silver dollars in this time came to an end in when congress passed an act the of most silver coins allowing new issues of them to as early as new york william alleged that that patterson had made the gold dollar too small in diameter on purpose to criticism patterson retired that year after years in his position and under his successor george n gold dollar and half dollar were struck public reported that although gold dollars would not be struck in form gold half dollars would be to help fill the need for change with the new administration thomas took office as mint director on march in april treasury secretary james wrote to that there were that the gold dollar was too small often lost or for a small silver coin and about reports the mint had with dollars stating that had been preserved but a silver piece of equivalent size he noted that while there would be technical in the production of the dollar these could be in a letter dated may proposed an shaped piece or an shaped coin which would the production problems died on may did not let the issue fall but s replacement james ross the issue on june as us coins were required to some of the secretary hoped that artists could be found who could find some such design for an coin the act of february that had the silver coins also a gold three dollar piece which began to be produced in to that the three dollar piece was not for other gold coins it had been made and than it would normally be and longacre put a design with an indian princess on it longacre adapted both the and the design for the gold dollar which was made and thus an of longacre s princess for the larger gold coin was placed on the dollar and a similar on the the idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in congress as early as and had been by but s for an coin the matter in may sent a letter stating that the with an coin especially in getting the coins to from the press were more than nevertheless the type gold dollar as it came to be known proved as the had difficulty in the new coin so that all details were brought out this was due to the high relief of the design — the three southern branch especially had with the piece many of the type pieces quickly became and were sent back to philadelphia for and on most surviving specimens the in the date is not fully the type gold dollar was struck only at philadelphia in and at the three southern branch in the latter year and at san francisco in after the design was designated for replacement to the problems longacre the head of making it a down version of the three dollar piece and moved the on the closer to the this improved the metal flow and design so much that early scholars assumed the was also though in fact no change was made and the type and type are design of type and dollars the type and gold dollars as a native american princess with a not any by any indian this image is an of the design longacre had made for the three dollar piece and is one of a number of versions of longacre created based on the or a sculpture then on display in a philadelphia museum for the longacre adapted the he had created for the of the three dollar piece composed of corn and the produce of north and south this would appear later in the s on the flying cent art historian the indian princess design used by longacre for the of the types and gold dollar and for the three dollar piece the princess of the gold coins is a s version of art of the s the or are more like the of the of wales than anything that saw the western save perhaps on a music hall war years the gold dollar continued to be produced in the late s though declined from the figures of two million or more each year between and only about gold dollars were produced in with over two of that figure at philadelphia just under a third at san francisco and at roughly a are known of the last creating one of the great from in the series the other candidate for the from that mint is the with an estimated of and perhaps to known two of dies were from philadelphia to on december they arrived on january two weeks before georgia voted to from the union as the american civil war began under from governor joseph e brown state the mint and at some point small of dollars and half were produced records of how many coins were struck and when have not survived since dies in time and all the were with them from philadelphia could not last and in may coins and remaining at were turned over to the treasury of the confederate states of america which georgia had by then joined gold coins with a face value of were put aside for normally they would have been sent to philadelphia to the following year s meeting of the united states commission when they would be available for instead these were sent to the initial confederate capital of though what was done with them there and their fate are unknown the of the dollar and the association with the make it especially like the other two branch in the south closed its after the it and the charlotte facility never the new mint again struck coins from to but did not strike gold dollars again after the only of gold dollars outside philadelphia was at san francisco in the outbreak of the civil war public in the union and citizens began gold and silver coins in late december banks and then the federal treasury out gold at face value by mid all federal coins even the base metal cent had from in much of the country the was the far west where for the most part only gold and silver were and paper money traded at a in the rest of the nation gold and silver coins could be purchased from banks exchange and from the treasury for a in the new the government began to issue to fill the in and the war final years and since gold did not in the united states except on the west coast in the period much of the production of coins of that metal in the united states was double for although gold dollars were struck in — the last time production would a million — the fell to in and remained low for the rest of the coin s existence and the mint felt it to of a coin by congress and issued coins generally a few to the community from dies also producing enough circulation so that the coins would not be rare in and old and gold dollars held by the government were and large of that denomination this was done in of the of which did not until the end of once again at face value the gold dollar found no place in large of silver either released from or newly struck by the mint the government expected that the of would cause the dollar and other small gold coins to again but the public allowed to paper continued to use it as more than coins in the s and s public interest grew in the low gold dollar coins was becoming more popular and a number of put aside some gold dollars and hoped for in value the mint most likely its production through some philadelphia though coins could be purchased for at the s window at the philadelphia facility banks a for circulation they were popular in the trade mounted into various items the coins were often to china or japan where such was made the dollars were often damaged in the process the mint refused to into this trade and did its best to it nevertheless mint officials concluded that were successful at getting the majority of each issue by and remained above that mark for the remainder of the series numbers likely by of willing to pay the mint s of per coin another use for the gold dollar was as a holiday gift after its the quarter became a popular present james in his final report as mint director in of gold dollars to who it the gold dollar is not a coin on account of its small size and it more from than larger coins his called for its with james p before he left office in writing to congress that except as little use has been found for this coin later that year the new director edward o issued a report stating that the gold dollar is too small for circulation and is used almost for the purposes of the last year in which the gold dollar was struck was congress the gold dollar along with the three cent and three dollar piece by the act of september a total of gold dollars were coined of which were struck at philadelphia at new at charlotte at san francisco and at according to an in the february issue of the gold dollars brought each still in demand as a present and for that journal in carried news of a gold dollars into a bank the of the value credited the account with per coin in a offered each for any as coin became a widespread in the early th century gold dollars became a popular a status they the edition of s a book of united states coins the least gold dollar in very condition at a value given for each of the type philadelphia issues from to those seeking one of each type will find the most to be a specimen of the type with the and estimated at in that condition the other two types have dates at in that grade gold dollars the gold dollar had a brief during the period of early united states coins between and nine different issues were produced with a total of these were for various public events did not and used longacre s design johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction the johnson – corey – chaykovsky reaction sometimes referred to as the corey – chaykovsky reaction or is a chemical reaction used in for the synthesis of and it was discovered in by a william johnson and developed significantly by e j corey

díaz and the francisco madero on may the treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting madero and those of díaz and thus concluded the initial of the revolution the treaty that díaz as well as his vice president were to step down by the end of may and that he was to be replaced by francisco de la as president and hold elections those who had suffered losses due to the revolution would be the and there would be a general díaz resigned on may and president francisco de la was the new díaz and his family his vice president and left mexico for significantly the treaty did not or institute any social that madero had on previous it also left the state additionally madero supported the idea that all land were to be through the by the old a decision that led to of violence particularly in rural areas on june madero entered mexico city in october he was elected president under the of the along with his new running as vice president madero aside francisco the vice candidate for the anti party in as being too moderate military leading up to the treaty the against the government of díaz broke out in late after díaz had his rival francisco madero and had announced his own victory in a election madero s earlier of had attracted many he himself from and to texas from where he issued his famous plan of san this called for an armed against the and establishment of free and elections as a response to madero s violent began throughout mexico in november in the district of orozco attacked federal troops and sent dead soldiers back to díaz with the van here are the me more he then began operations which threatened additionally political support for madero s came from who accepted the plan of san at roughly the same time in the state of turned into a full under the of the zapata brothers and orozco and villa take by the news of the madero the border back into mexico in february he was joined by villa and orozco and in april the army began orozco and villa led the way with men each while madero followed up with the city was by the end of the month after madero s army some resistance in the madero asked the commander of the city s to but the latter refused that the he had constructed would him to the city until arrived concerned also with the possibility that a direct attack on the town would cause artillery shells to cross the border into the united states which could an outside and faced with a series of peace from díaz madero in the city he in fact ordered his to the orozco however the order and joined by villa attacked after two days of fighting the city fell to the madero to the life of the city s commander whom both orozco and villa wanted executed for his previous killing of this with the fact that both leaders were by madero in his political and them from him zapata in south and central mexico at about the same time that villa and orozco were on the and spread to the states of mexico and on april madero had zapata officially designated as his representative in the region however zapata was that if he did not fully control all the major in by the time that madero concluded with díaz the of his movement and the issue of the of would be or zapata s first military action was to take the town of where he obtained essential subsequently zapata for political and reasons decided to attack the city of in order to his opponents however he initially attacked and captured the of de which was subsequently by federal forces and from there he made a wide circle around and captured and where he more and soldiers by may out of all the major urban in the region only and the capital of remained outside of his control zapata began the attack on on may with troops against soldiers of the so called golden fifth the fifth of the federal army the battle took almost a week and has been described as six of the most days of battle in the whole revolution it consisted of house to house fighting hand to hand and no quarter given by either side general arrived in nearby with but decided not to come to the relief of as he was that the capital would in his absence on may the remains of the golden fifth out of the town which was then occupied by zapata s soldiers the successful capture of made zapata a to people throughout mexico and new were written about him after zapata s taking of the federal government controlled only five states and some urban areas díaz himself later stated that while he felt that he could against villa and orozco in the fall of was the event which him to to peace with madero the as early as march madero s met in new york with díaz s minister and the to the us in order to the possibility of peace between the two sides proposed an end to the and offered an for all the of the then vice president the replacement of four díaz and ten state by ones by madero and the establishment of the of no which would prevent díaz from seeking yet another term as president which would have been his ninth madero responded although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an by díaz faced with the of and the outbreak of in díaz and members of his became more willing to and launched a peace offensive at madero this was largely a result of among the large associated with the díaz regime the and the financial which represented a moderate wing within the government some among the in fact expected that zapata would soon march on mexico city itself unless peace was concluded with madero the moderate view within the díaz government was represented by who in a to the minister of foreign affairs wrote that there were two taking place in mexico a political revolution based mostly in the north whose aim was mostly to establish free elections and díaz himself from power and a social revolution whose aim was which was throughout the recommended coming to terms with the first group of by to the of no re election and a general in order to prevent the second group from in addition to his fear of was also that the social revolution would lead to a military by the united states s views represented those of the portion of the upper class which was willing to come to terms with at least a portion of the middle class in order to the as by those of zapata which were throughout mexico who agreed with had the support of the who the of international credit and a general economic as a result of social as well as that of the large who were willing to come to terms with madero if it would put an end to the these social group were in turn opposed by the more elements within díaz s government mostly in the federal army who though that the should be with through force this was represented by general who would later out an attempted coup d against madero the general and potential successor to díaz stated in a letter to that the against the should be carried out with the energy without any in the armed in the end however díaz the from his as like and chose to peace with the moderate wing of the revolution had finally managed to him to at the same time there was also among the the left wing of the movement represented by zapata and orozco villa for the time being to support madero against any possible with díaz in the end their proved as the treaty that was eventually signed issues of social and land that were central to their the treaty s terms the most significant point of the treaty was that díaz and his vice president and that de la acting as president free elections as soon as possible additionally the treaty that an for all be declared with the option for some of them to for in the the forces were to be as soon as possible and the federal forces were to be the only army in mexico this was in order to the army which had opposed a with madero madero and his had the right to name fourteen state and to la s were to be established for of the soldiers who had died fighting the and as well as state that had been appointed or elected under díaz were to their and results the treaty was signed on may díaz resigned on may francisco de la became the president madero entered mexico city on june zapata however refused to the government of de la and for the time being the fighting in continued madero met with zapata on several during june while initially zapata madero with time he became increasingly concerned that the goals of his revolution were not being he was particularly that madero did not plan on carrying out any kind of or the of large additionally the press in mexico city controlled by the began to zapata as a and federal such as continued his troops under the that zapata failed to in violation of the treaty fighting in southern mexico continued in november shortly after madero s zapata issued the famous plan of in which the madero and instead recognized orozco as the president and leader of the revolution madero also earned the great of other including orozco madero s first act after the treaty was signed was a of with the díaz regime as a result of the treaty he was given the right to members of the la he chose mostly upper class including his wife for the post in the treasury he also maintained the existing federal system by the of the court the in federal and state and the of the various federal who was going to become a major in his own right and a future president of mexico stated that after the treaty madero had ed to the a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again díaz after leaving for in france observed that madero has a let us see if he can control him orozco who saw himself as being in madero s victory over díaz was appointed as a commander of the in which increased his when he tried to run for governor of the state madero supported his and eventually orozco to out of the race when in the of the plan of madero ordered orozco to lead federal troops to zapata orozco refused in march orozco issued his plan of and formally declared himself in against madero the feast of the goat the feast of the goat spanish la is a novel by the prize in literature vargas llosa the book is set in the dominican republic and the assassination of dominican dictator trujillo and its from two distinct a generation during and immediately after the assassination itself in may and thirty five years later in throughout there is also extensive on the of the in the s and its significance for the island and its the novel follows three storylines the first a woman urania cabral who is back in the dominican republic after a long absence to visit her father she ends up from her and a long held secret to her and the second story line on the last day in trujillo s life from the moment he up and shows us the regime s inner circle to which urania s father once the third strand depicts trujillo s many of whom had previously been government as they for his car late that night after the assassination this story line shows us the each of the book s plot a different on the dominican republic s political and social environment past and present are shown the regime s trujillo s assassination and its through the of and a middle woman looking back the novel is therefore a of power including its effects and its long term impact the novel s themes include the nature of power and and their relationship to and sexual in a society with strongly roles memory and the process of is also an important theme especially in urania s narrative as she her in the dominican republic her story and the book as a whole ends when she the events that led to her leaving the country at the age of the book itself serves as a of the of to that the of power will be by a new generation vargas llosa fictional elements and historical events the book is not a documentary and the cabral family for instance is completely fictional on the other hand the characters of trujillo and trujillo s are drawn from the historical record vargas llosa real historical of and into these people s to further the nature of the regime and the it in vargas llosa s words it s a novel not a history book so took many many have the basic but have changed and many things in order to make the story more — and have not the feast of the goat received largely positive reviews with several on the book s of the relationship between sexuality and power and on the of violent events a film version of the novel was released in paul and and his daughter wrote a theatrical in background the feast of the goat is only the second of vargas llosa s to be set outside the first being the war of the end of the world it is also unusual because it is the first to have a female as critic of the leading character in the feast of the goat and also vargas llosa s subsequent book the way to both are unlike any of the other female characters in his previous the novel the regime of trujillo in the dominican republic trujillo was in historian s words a influence in dominican and history who over one of the most of the century during the thirty one years between his of power in and his assassination in trujillo had with the united states corps during the united states occupation of the island and graduated from the military academy in after the us in he became head of the dominican national police which under his command was into the dominican national army and trujillo s personal power base trujillo was officially dictator only from to and from to but remained in power throughout the entire period though his regime was daniel that he had no particular and that his economic and social policies were the novel s title is taken from the popular dominican al they killed the goat which to trujillo s assassination on may is a style of music created by in the s and promoted by trujillo himself it is now considered the country s national music cultural critics and stephen about this particular that by the dictator as an animal who could be turned into a as frequently with struck down on the dominican republic s the song gave those performing to and to this a sense of control over him and over themselves that they had not experienced for over three decades vargas llosa the lyrics to al at the beginning of the novel plot the novel s narrative is divided into three distinct one is on urania cabral a fictional dominican character another with the involved in trujillo s assassination and the third on trujillo himself the novel between these storylines and also back and forth from to with frequent to periods earlier in trujillo s regime the feast of the goat begins with the return of urania to her of a city which had been renamed trujillo during trujillo s time in power this storyline is largely and with urania s and her inner over the events her departure from the dominican republic thirty five years earlier urania the trujillo regime in by claiming she planned to study under the of in in the following decades she becomes a prominent and successful new york she finally to the dominican republic in on a and herself to her father and elements of her past she has long as urania to her father cabral she more and more of the anger and that led to her thirty five years of urania her father s into political and the that forms the of both urania s storyline and that of trujillo himself the second and third storylines are set in in the weeks prior to and following trujillo s assassination on may each has his own background story his for his involvement in the assassination plot each has been by trujillo and his regime by and or through on their their religious faith their or their ones vargas llosa the tale of the men as recalled on the night of trujillo s death as the in for the goat with these are the actions of other famous of the time the president the head of the military intelligence service and various others — some real some of historical figures and some fictional the third storyline is concerned with the and of trujillo himself the the goat the major events of his time including the of of dominican in they also deal with the dominican republic s international relationships during the war especially with the united states under the of john f and under vargas llosa also upon trujillo s and a picture of a man whose physical body is him trujillo is by and and this storyline with urania s narrative when it is revealed that urania was by trujillo he is unable to achieve an with urania and in and anger he her with his hands this event is the core of urania s and her towards her father in addition it is the cause of trujillo s anger over the little that his and and the reason he is route to with another girl on the night of his assassination in the novel s final the three storylines with increasing the of these is especially dark as they deal primarily with the and death of the at the hands of the the of the coup the of urania and the made to trujillo s most allowing them to their on the and then escape the country the book ends as urania to return home determined this time to keep in with her family back on the island characters modern day urania cabral and her father cabral appear in both the modern

following the assassination he out with de la and dies fighting in the of the assassination and de la to fight the members of who come to them to in battle rather than be captured and major themes the feast of the goat s major themes include political memory and writing and power for the age suggests that overall vargas llosa s aim is to the forces of latin tradition that give rise to political the structure of dominican society was with strongly roles trujillo the ruler was a dictator who the people of even years after his death he is a true with and he a cult in his society and within his regime prior to promotion to a position of responsibility an officer is required to pass a test of his people are to remain to him all cost and are by public and even though acts of were rare trujillo women and children as an of political and sexual power and in some cases takes the wife or child of his many of whom still remain even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the for pleasure many of the had to the trujillo regime or had at one point been its only to find their support for him by the state s against its people one of the up this in a by the murder of the sisters they kill our our brothers our friends and now they re killing our women and here we sit resigned our turn in an interview vargas llosa describes the and of trujillo s regime he had more or less all the common of a latin american dictator but to the extreme in think he went far far away from the rest — and in too according to scholar peter the two important of are aggressive behaviour and sexuality aggressive behaviour is by of power and while sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many as possible these two shape the of trujillo and his regime in the feast of the goat as vargas llosa of of and of child practices that the of children so that each generation a of the soul to the subsequent one in a display of both aspects of trujillo of his and that they provide him with sexual access to their and vargas llosa wrote of trujillo s and treatment of women h e went to with his not only because he these but because it was a way to test his he wanted to know if they were to accept this extreme mainly the were prepared to play this role — and they remained to trujillo even after his death trujillo s sexual and public of his enemies also serve to his political power and in s words the is that maximum political trujillo s attempted sexual of urania is an example of both political of cabral and sexual power over young women however as trujillo s remains throughout the and he is in front of the young girl the to his for memory all of the novel s storylines memory in some sense or another the most of memory is on the part of urania cabral who has returned to the dominican republic for the first time in years and is forced to her father and the that led her to leave the country at she was the of sexual at the hands of the dictator himself a her father made to to with the dictator again a fact to which she throughout the book but which is only revealed at the very end the book with her the memory of that night to her and who never knew the true reason she left the country when her is that she all these details she that while she many things everything about that night for urania the by the regime is her father on the other hand is not capable of her in this process of since he has suffered a and is not capable of speaking however urania is that he chose to these things while he was still capable of them memory is also important in the of the novel that deal with the each the events that led him to take part in the assassination of trujillo these included the and murder the murder of the sisters and the with the catholic church these historical events are used by vargas llosa to the with specific that the violence of trujillo s regime trujillo too is shown on the past not least his own formation and training at the hands of the us but above all vargas llosa uses the fictional urania to the novel s attempt at the regime the novel and with urania s story the narrative in the terms of the past and understanding its in the present in addition because of her academic study of the history of the trujillo regime urania is also the memory of the regime for the country as a whole this is in with one purpose of the book which is to that the of the and the of power will be by a new generation writing and power in her treatment of the novel claims that power gives its the ability to make that are in history the study of which what is and what is not told the government s actions in the feast of the goat the of foreign and were prohibited from entering trujillo s country as they were seen as a threat to the government s ideas vargas llosa takes part in this by what was prohibited notes that writing also has the power to reality it the back to the past allowing the to myths or told by historians that the past is to one s understanding of the present that takes us to and that the feast of the goat can thus be seen as a that gives power to history the construction of surrounding the events of trujillo s regime a degree of freedom from the that took places author that these events can only finally be by only finally be by the while richard patterson claims that vargas llosa and to a large degree trujillo and his reign through use of narrative structure vargas llosa s writing acts as a force for this period in history fact and the novel is a of fact and together these two elements is important in any historical novel but especially in the feast of the goat because vargas llosa chose to an event through the of both real and fictional characters some characters are fictional and those that are non fictional still have aspects in the book the general details of the assassination are true and the are all real people while they in for the dictator to they of the regime such as the murder of the sisters however other details are by vargas llosa such as s murder of the brother of the woman he those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people president is real but the entire cabral family is completely fictional according to vargas llosa uses history as a starting point in a account of trujillo s spiritual of the dominican republic as experienced by one dominican family the fictional cabral family vargas llosa to show two sides of the trujillo regime through the and to the leader of the nation through urania the violence of the regime and the of it left behind vargas llosa also the of the characters who were non fictional especially those of the goat himself according to scholar richard patterson vargas llosa s all the way into the very dark area of trujillo s as the to it vargas llosa also built an image of the regime with the historical events with to the historical of the book vargas llosa has said it s a novel not a history book so took many many the only on was that was not going to anything that t have within the of life in the dominican republic have the basic but have changed and many things in order to make the story more — and have not critical reception the style of the feast of the goat is recognized by some as being a break from a more approach to the dictator novel the novel received largely positive reviews most of which were willing to accept of historical in of good a common on the novel is the nature of the many acts of and murder which are depicted in the novel vargas the see the of an regime with a degree of not often used by his in latin american literature as michael wood suggests in the london review of books vargas llosa us far more about the details of day to day and the of and murder of the new york times suggests that the scenes of and cast other aspects of the novel in a light them of their significance and impact similarly that the narrative mentioned by wood as being somewhat also produces a largely storyline the plot line on urania cabral is described by as being an emotional centre that the novel and wood that her with past demons hold the attention in contrast s review states that urania s are and and to be on loan from another of book most reviews of the feast of the goat make either of direct to the relationship between sexuality and power writer for the and michael wood each the connection between trujillo s loss of control both over his body and his the means by which trujillo political power through sexual acts and begins to personal as his body him are of frequent among in author of the non book trujillo the death of the goat accused vargas llosa of plagiarism an english language film of the novel was made in directed by llosa vargas llosa s it stars as urania cabral paul as her father as and as trujillo it was filmed in both the dominican republic and in the film for the trade paper variety critic called it less a feast than a somewhat but three course that the main difference from the source novel was the of the novel has also been adapted for the stage by and his daughter directed by the play was put on in spanish but with to english

german policy further calling for the complete destruction of the polish people whom the nazis regarded as within ten to twenty years the polish territories under german occupation were to be entirely of ethnic poles and by german the policy was somewhat in the final years of occupation – in view of german military and the eastern front the germans hoped that a more cultural policy would and the polish resistance poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported german propaganda and such as the newly created museum which the s german roots on education theater and music performances were given that the second polish republic was a state german policies and propaganda also sought to create and between ethnic groups between poles and jews and between poles and in the germans forced jews to help destroy a monument to a polish tadeusz and filmed them the act soon the germans set fire to a jewish synagogue and filmed polish them in propaganda releases as a this policy was in the germans decision to destroy polish education while at the same time relative toward the school system as the high nazi official explained we must do everything possible so that when a a he will be willing to kill the and the will be willing to kill the in as the occupation regime was being established the nazis polish state property and much private property art objects were and taken to germany in line with a plan that had been drawn up well in advance of the invasion the was by of the units who were responsible for art and by of who were responsible for more objects notable items by the nazis included the altar of and paintings by da and most of the important art pieces had been by the nazis within six months of september by the end of german officials estimated that

war according to one by war s end of the of poland s educational and research institutions and of its museums had been destroyed according to another only of pre war poland s museums survived the war and just of these institutions were able to of pre war poland s scientific institutions about half were destroyed and only a few survived the war relatively many university as well as teachers artists writers and other members of the polish were arrested and executed or to concentration camps during operations such as this particular campaign resulted in the and the of during world war poland lost to of its and to of its to of its teachers to of its and university and to of its the jewish was the behind this policy was by a nazi in my district any who shows signs of intelligence will be shot as part of their program to polish culture the german nazis attempted to destroy in poland with a particular emphasis on the roman catholic church in some parts of occupied poland poles were or even from religious services at the same time church property was were placed on using the polish language in religious services organizations with the catholic church were and it was to perform certain religious songs — or to read of the — in public the worst conditions were found in the which the nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti religious policies polish and religious leaders among of the that were for to the rise of a new generation of poles german officials that the of polish children would be limited to a few years of elementary education wrote in a of may the purpose of this is to them nothing above the number how to write one s name and the that it is divine law to the germans do not a knowledge of as frank him the poles do not need universities or secondary schools the polish are to be converted into an the situation was particularly in the former polish territories beyond the general government which had been to the third the specific policy from territory to territory but in general there was no polish language education at all german policy a of the polish teachers were and some were invited to with the new administration where they were either arrested or executed on the spot some polish were sent to german schools while others were sent to special schools where they spent most of their time as usually on german run speaking polish brought severe punishment it was expected that polish children would to work once they finished their primary education at age to in the eastern territories not included in the general government and many primary schools were closed and most education was conducted in non polish such as and in the region for example of the schools that had before the war were closed down during the first two years of german occupation and by the end of the following year that figure had increased to the state of polish primary schools was somewhat better in the general government though by the end of only of schools were and only of polish children attended them a german police of august described the situation as follows sit together without necessary materials and often without teaching staff the polish schools are closed during at least five months out of the ten months of the school year due to lack of or other of twenty thirty school buildings which had before today the worst two buildings are used every day have to study in several under such circumstances the school day which normally five hours is reduced to one hour in the general government the remaining schools were to the german educational system and the number and of their polish staff was down all universities and most secondary schools were closed if not immediately after the invasion then by mid by late no official polish educational institutions more advanced than a school remained in operation and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the nazi economy primary was to last for seven years but the classes in the final two years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week there was no money for of the schools in winter classes and schools were to be polish teachers and the resulting used to the creation of schools for children of the german or to create for german troops no new polish teachers were to be the educational was such as literature history and were removed old were and school were closed the new educational for poles included them that their national fate was and teaching them to be and to germans this was through such as police on schools police of student mass of students and teachers and the use of students as forced often by them to germany as workers the germans were especially active in the destruction of jewish culture in poland nearly all of the wooden there were destroyed the of jewish literature was banned throughout poland polish literature faced a similar fate in territories by germany where the of polish books was the public destruction of polish books was not limited to those from but also included those books that were from private homes the last polish book titles not already were in even polish books were soon after the occupation began most were closed in about of the were closed immediately while the remainder saw their collections by the powers destroyed polish book collections including the and library the library the library the central military library and the collection in the last remaining polish public library in the german occupied territories was closed in warsaw during the war warsaw lost about a million or of their collections more than of these losses were the direct result of rather than conflict overall it is estimated that about million from state owned and institutions during the war polish and other were the war on the polish language included the down of signs in polish and the of polish in public places persons who polish in the were often and even the of place names many of polish culture – including and monuments to national eg s adam monument – were destroyed in all polish monuments and were down of monuments were destroyed throughout poland the nazis planned to level entire cities and propaganda the germans prohibited publication of any regular polish language book study or paper in several german controlled houses began operating in occupied poland publishing items such as polish german and and at first books that were considered to be serious including scientific and educational texts and texts that were thought to promote polish only that was free of anti german was permitted banned literature included and english and french language publications including several non public of prohibited books were created and over polish writers were declared to the german state and culture the of banned authors included such polish authors as adam julian staff and of such books was and by door to door of books was banned and — which required a to operate — were either out or closed poles were under penalty of death to own the press was reduced from over publications to a few all by the germans all pre war were closed and the few that were published during the occupation were new under the total control of the germans such a destruction of the press was in contemporary history the only officially available matter was the propaganda press that was by the german occupation administration now under the control of the german propaganda machine saw their by nazi german which were by propaganda the few polish films permitted to be shown about of the total were to eliminate to polish national as well as jewish actors and producers several propaganda films were shot in polish although no polish films were shown after as all from polish were officially directed toward german war production was by the polish underground a famous underground declared w only the a similar situation faced theaters which were by the germans to produce serious a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater theatrical were also by the underground in addition actors were from performing in them and that they would be as if they failed to on cultural performances were in jewish given that the germans to and prevent them from their fate music was the least of cultural activities probably because frank regarded himself as a of serious music in time he ordered the creation of the and of the general government in its capital numerous musical performances were permitted in and and the polish underground chose to only the visual artists including and were to register with the german government but their work was generally by the underground unless it themes museums were replaced by art that frequently themes the development of nazi propaganda in occupied poland can be divided into two main initial efforts were directed towards creating a negative image of pre war poland and later efforts were at anti soviet and pro german soviet occupation after the soviet invasion of poland beginning september that followed the german invasion that had marked the start of world war beginning september the soviet union the eastern parts of the second polish republic square sq mi and a population of million and shared the goal of poland s political and cultural life so that poland would according to historian to exist not as a place but also as an idea the soviet authorities regarded service to the polish state as a crime against revolution and activity and arrested many members of the polish civil and as well as persons of a threat to soviet rule more than a million polish citizens were to many to concentration camps for years or decades others died including over military officers who in the the soviets quickly the they proceeded to and private and state owned polish property in the process they banned political parties and public and or executed their leaders as enemies of the people in line with soviet anti religious policy and religious organizations were on february the a campaign of against anti soviet elements in occupied poland the soviets included persons who often persons involved in red cross workers and members of religious the and and like worked to eliminate polish society the soviet authorities sought to all of the polish history of the area now under their control the name poland was banned polish monuments were down all institutions of the polish state including the university were closed then mostly with new russian directors soviet became in all teaching polish literature and language studies were by the soviet authorities and the polish language was replaced with russian or polish language books were burned even in the primary schools polish teachers were not allowed in the schools and many were arrested classes were held in and with a new pro soviet as polish canadian historian noted citing british historians r foot and b majority of scholars believe that in the soviet occupation zone conditions were only less than under the germans in september many polish jews had east after some months of living under soviet rule some of them wanted to return to the german zone of occupied poland all publications and media were to the soviets sought to polish left wing who were willing to soon after the soviet invasion the writers association of soviet created a local chapter in there was a polish language theater and radio station polish cultural activities in and were less organized these activities were controlled by the soviet authorities which saw to it that these activities the new soviet regime in a positive light and the former polish government the soviet propaganda support for polish language cultural activities however with the official policy of the soviets at first intended to out the polish language and so banned polish from schools street signs and other aspects of life this policy was however at times — first before the elections in october and later after the german of france in november the poles of observed the th of adam s death soon however decided to re the policies he his decision again however when a need for polish language pro soviet propaganda following the german invasion of the soviet union as a result permitted the creation of polish forces in the east and later decided to create a people s republic of poland many polish writers collaborated with the soviets writing pro soviet propaganda they included jerzy tadeusz boy jan jerzy tadeusz jan jerzy julian jerzy jerzy julian adam and other polish writers however rejected the soviet and instead published underground jerzy tadeusz some writers such as after with the soviets for a few months joined the anti soviet similarly initially to was arrested by the soviet secret police and to underground culture polish culture in underground education publications even theater the polish underground state created a department of education and culture under which along with a department of labor and social under jan and later and a department for of the effects of war under and became underground of polish culture these efforts to save from and destruction works of art in state and private collections most notably the giant paintings by jan that were throughout the war they reports on and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families thus they the underground publication of works by and and of copies of a polish primary school and commissioned artists to create resistance which was then by operation n and like activities also occasionally were secret art theater performances and other important of polish culture included the roman catholic church and polish who supported artists and polish heritage notable included adam and a former some private including and the publishing house paid writers for books that would be after the war education in response to the german and of polish schools resistance among teachers led almost immediately to the creation of large scale underground educational activities most notably the secret teaching organization was created as early as in october other organizations were created after they were increasingly and by the working closely with the underground s state department of culture and education which was created in and headed by creator of the classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other by about students took part in underground primary education in its secondary school system covered people and university level were attended by about students for the pre war at polish universities was about for the year more than secondary school attended underground classes held by nearly teachers between and in four of the general government on the cities of warsaw and overall in that period in the general government one of every three children was receiving some of education from the underground organizations the number rose to about for children old enough to secondary school it is estimated that in some rural areas the educational was actually improved most likely as were being organized in some cases by teachers or from the cities compared to pre war classes the absence of polish jewish students was notable as they were by the nazi germans to there was however underground jewish education in the often organized with support from polish organizations like students at the underground schools were often also members of the polish resistance in warsaw there were over underground schools with teachers and students underground warsaw university students and warsaw under occupation students ones and university issued and employed over and teachers and served more than students per year throughout poland many other universities and institutions of higher education of music theater arts and others continued their classes throughout the war even some academic research was carried out for example by a leading polish and a nearly polish received from the underground state them to continue their research the german to underground education on whether it took place in the general government or the territories the germans had almost realized the full scale of the polish underground education system by about but the to put an end to it probably to with the armed resistance for the most part underground schools and in the general government was not a top for the germans in a german report on education admitted that control of what was being taught in schools particularly rural ones was difficult due to lack of transportation and the activities of the polish resistance some schools semi taught in of the german authorities frank noted in that although polish teachers were a enemy of the german states they could not all be of immediately it was as a much more serious issue in the territories as it the process of involvement in the underground education in those territories was much more likely to result in a to a concentration camp there were over underground among the most important were the of and of the government for poland in addition to publication of news from western radio there were of underground publications dedicated to politics education and literature for example the highest recorded publication volume was an issue of in copies average volume of larger publication was – copies the polish underground also published and from anti nazi german organizations at and among the germans books were also sometimes other items were also such as or german administration the germans to poland or poles to register the two largest underground were the of information and propaganda of and the government for poland secret military publishing house of jerzy to the was probably the largest underground in the world in addition to polish titles also false german designed to of the german forces as part of action n the majority of polish underground were located in occupied warsaw until the warsaw in the summer of the germans found over underground whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps the second largest center for polish underground publishing was there writers and faced similar for example almost the entire staff of the underground paper was arrested and its chief were executed in on may was the longest published polish underground paper to issues were published starting in october the underground press was supported by a large number of in addition to the crews the of underground the publications according to some statistics these were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the germans under german occupation the of polish journalists and writers were eliminated as they had little opportunity to their work the underground state s department of culture various and individuals them to continue their work and in their publication and were published by underground over works were published underground over the course of the war were held and prominent writers of the period working in poland included among others tadeusz tadeusz boy tadeusz future prize winner jan staff and jerzy writers wrote about the difficult conditions in the of war camps and the and even from inside the concentration camps jan tadeusz and many writers did not the war among them tadeusz boy tadeusz tadeusz and visual arts and music with the of polish theater and the end of the polish radio and film industry underground theaters were created primarily in warsaw and with shows presented in various underground beginning in the theaters were by the secret theatrical council four large companies and more than smaller groups were active throughout the war even in the s in warsaw and in underground acting schools were also created underground actors many of whom officially worked included tadeusz jan adam edmund who later became pope john paul jerzy and others theater was also active in the jewish and in the camps for polish war prisoners polish music including also went underground top polish musicians and directors adam jan jerzy edmund jerzy performed in and private homes with the most on the while german songs were written such as the most popular song of occupied warsaw shows were jewish musicians eg and artists performed in and even in concentration camps although many of them died some survived like in the united states and and in the soviet union visual arts were underground as well and private homes were turned into or museums some were closed with their staff and arrested or even executed polish underground artists included and some artists worked directly for the underground state money and and creating anti nazi art and or polish for example these works were on underground and those intended for public display were to walls or painted on them as many of these activities were under the action n operation of s of information and propaganda in three giant m or ft of and were successfully in public places in warsaw some artists recorded life and death in occupied poland despite german on poles using photographs and even films were taken although it was to operate an underground radio station underground were recorded and introduced into german or systems underground were designed and issued since the germans also banned polish activities underground were created underground football matches and even were organized in warsaw and although these were usually by the germans all of these activities were supported by the underground state s department of culture warsaw during the warsaw august – october people in polish controlled

influence on culture the attempts to destroy polish culture may have it instead norman wrote in god s in as a prize for the of the to their native culture was than ever before similarly close underground classes from primary schools to universities were for their high quality due in large part to the lower of students to teachers the resulting culture was however different from the culture of poland for a number of reasons the destruction of poland s jewish community poland s changes and left poland without its historic ethnic the nation was no more the experience of world war placed its on a generation of polish artists that became known as the generation of the term an entire generation of poles born soon after poland in whose was marked by world war in their art they discovered a new poland – one changed by the of world war and the creation of a poland over the years nearly three of the polish people have the importance of world war to the polish national identity many polish works of art created since the war have on events of the war books by tadeusz and others films including those by a generation and a love in germany tv series four men and a dog and larger than life music and even books – all of these works have those times polish historian wrote in educational and training place special emphasis on the world war period and on the occupation events and

long barrow the coldrum long barrow also known as the coldrum stones and the stones is a long barrow located near to the village of in the south eastern english county of kent constructed during britain s early neolithic period today it only in a state archaeologists have established that the monument was built by communities shortly after the of to britain from continental europe although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across neolithic europe the coldrum stones to a regional of produced in the of the river medway now known as the medway megaliths of these it is in the best surviving condition and near to both long barrow and long barrow on the western side of the river three further surviving long kit s house the little

chamber into which human remains were on at least two separate during the early neolithic analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least individuals a of men women children and adults at least one of the bodies had been prior to burial a tradition of and secondary burial as with other coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead perhaps as part of a belief system involving although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious and cultural and uses after the early neolithic the long barrow fell into a state of

neolithic britain the early neolithic was a period of british history beginning in the fifth it saw a widespread change in as the communities living in the british adopted as their primary form of the hunter that had the period archaeologists have been unable to whether this of was because of a new of coming in from continental europe or because the came to the practices of continental either way it emerged through contact with continental europe probably as a result of centuries of interaction between people living in south east britain and culture communities in north eastern france the region of modern kent would have been a key area for the of continental european and visitors because of its position on the of the river thames and its to the between and all of the british came to its former hunter to be replaced by the new of the neolithic age although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the british in this period there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement architectural styles and the use of natural throughout most of britain there is little evidence of or permanent from this period leading archaeologists to believe that the early neolithic economy on the island was largely on with people living a or semi way of life although some land britain was largely in this period and it is what level of the area of kent had experienced in the early neolithic widespread only took place on the of south east britain in the late age environmental data from the area around the white stone the idea that the area was still largely in the early neolithic covered by a of and the tomb building tradition across western europe the early neolithic marked the first period in which humans built structures in the these were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead and though sometimes constructed out of many were built using large stones now known as megaliths individuals were rarely buried alone in the early neolithic instead being in with other members of their community the construction of these burial tombs both wooden and megalithic began in continental europe before being adopted in britain in the first half of the fourth the early neolithic people of britain placed far greater emphasis on the burial of the dead than their had done many archaeologists have suggested that this is because early neolithic people to an cult that the of the dead that they could with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living archaeologist that rather than simply being tombs the medway megaliths were a social for the communities who built and used them thus it has been suggested that early neolithic people entered into the tombs – which as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would the dead and for their for this reason historian these monuments tomb shrines to their purpose in britain these tombs were typically located on prominent and the surrounding perhaps at the between different territories archaeologist noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of in the that information on territory political and many archaeologists have to the idea that these tomb shrines served as between different groups although others have argued that such would be of little use to a society instead it has been suggested that they represent along many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments an attempt to control and over the land thus representing a change in brought about by others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by hunter archaeologists have these early neolithic tombs into a variety of different architectural styles each typically associated with a different region within the british passage by their passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone were located in northern britain and southern and central ireland across northern ireland and central britain long while in the east and south east of britain long represented the architectural these long were typically constructed of because building stone was in southern britain archaeologist argued that these tombs might have been even more eye than their stone perhaps consisting of carved poles painted but that evidence of such sculptures has not survived the medway megaliths represent just one of these regional groups within the west european tradition of tomb building in this period the medway megaliths although now all in a state and not their original appearance at the time of construction the medway megaliths would have been some of the largest and most early neolithic monuments in britain along the river medway as it through the north they the most south group of megalithic monuments in the british and the only megalithic group in eastern england archaeologists and mike deemed the medway megaliths to be some of the most and well known archaeological sites in kent while archaeologist paul described them as the most and structures of their kind in southern england they can be divided into two separate one to the west of the river medway and the other on blue hill to the east with the distance between the two measuring at between and km the western group includes coldrum long barrow long barrow and the long barrow the eastern group consists of kit s house little kit s house the stone and several other stones which might have once been parts of tombs it is not known if they were all built at the same time or whether they were constructed in while similarly it is not known if they each served the same or whether there was a in their the medway long all to the same general design plan and are all on an east to west axis each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound and they each probably had a stone the entrance the chambers were constructed from a hard and stone that occurs throughout kent having formed out of from the early neolithic would have selected from the local area and then them to the site of the monument to be erected such common architectural features among these tomb shrines a strong regional with no direct in the british for instance they would have been than most other tomb shrines in britain with of up to ft nevertheless as with other regional of early neolithic tomb shrines such as the group there are also various in the different monuments such as coldrum s shape the long barrow s and the long at and kit s this variation might have been caused by the tomb shrines being and adapted over the course of their use in this the monuments would represent structures it seems that the people who built these monuments were influenced by pre existing tomb shrines that they were already of whether those people had grown up or moved into the medway area from is not known based on a analysis of their architectural piggott thought that they had in the area around the low countries while daniel instead believed that the same evidence an influence from john h evans instead suggested an in germany and f thought that their could be seen in the megalithic group noted that their close in the same area was of the megalithic tomb shrine of continental northern europe and that the medway megaliths were a regional of a tradition widespread across early neolithic europe he nevertheless that a place of was to with the available evidence design and construction the monument originally consisted of a stone chamber covered by a low mound which was by as such the archaeologist paul asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features the chamber the barrow and the stone it is located on the edge of a large although it is difficult to what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction due to a lack of information on how the was however if the area was not highly then ° views of the surrounding would have been possible the monument s axis points toward both the north and the medway valley which is similar to the other medway megaliths archaeologist suggested that the coldrum long barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement and that this may have been a key in the experience of and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have a link between the tomb and the it had been built using about stones the barrow is in plan and about feet in length at its eastern end where the chamber is located the monument measures metres feet while at the western end it is metres feet in as such the barrow is a shape the megalithic responsible for the coldrum stones it on the top of a small to the north and constructed it facing towards the river medway the chamber of the monument measures metres feet in length and metres feet inches in although it was much larger when originally constructed the chamber s height would have been at least metres feet inches in its current state the northern side of the chamber is made up of two one being feet long feet inches deep and foot inches thick and the other feet long feet deep and feet thick the chamber s southern side consists of a single measuring feet inches in length feet inches in depth and foot inches in depth at its eastern end the western end of the chamber is closed off with a measuring about feet inches wide with a of foot and a depth of around feet a broken at the opening eastern end of the chamber it is also possible that a largely at the bottom of the had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber excavation has revealed that was used to around the chamber and support its century has seen this largely replaced with allowing the stones to continue standing it is possible that there was a in front of the chamber as is at other tombs in britain such as west long barrow and s it is also possible that there was a stone the chamber as was at kit s house and lower kit s house many of the larger of stone that have down the on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this or the mound that once covered the tomb is now only as an approximately foot inches in height in the century the mound was higher on the western end of the tomb although this was removed by excavation to the during the s it is likely that in the early neolithic the mound had a surrounding it and it is inside this that the stones now sit the stones around the tomb display some those on the northern side are mostly while those on the southern side are smaller and largely in shape it is that there was an dry stone wall constructed using of from the beds as is at long barrow given that such of stone rarely it may have been a line of and can be found on both one of the central stones on the western end of the monument and a stone on the south east of the monument these have been attributed to the of and other stone on these it is possible that these were for use in cutting and carving the and which would have been used in the stones and the tomb similar evidence for the of has been found at west long barrow as well as later monuments such as coldrum long barrow is isolated from the other medway megaliths in this it is unique given that the other surviving examples are into two groups however it is possible that another tomb was located nearby a mound with an east west is located in a at the foot of the just under a quarter of a mile to the north of the coldrum stones it may be that this represents the of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried several large to the south of the might represent the of a further such tomb since destroyed human remains suggested that given its size and with other long such as s the coldrum tomb could have the remains of over a individuals excavations conducted in the early th century have led to the discovery and of what was believed to be the remains of twenty two human individuals these remains were by sir arthur the of the museum at the royal college of he published his results in in a paper largely concerned with characteristics of the bodies a subsequent re analysis of the bones was conducted in the early st century and published in the of the society in the project presented analysis of dates and and stable analysis to on the burial practices and and of the coldrum population earlier it stated that the number of individuals was these were then further identified as probably to nine adults probably five males and four females two adults four older children and two children one around five years old the other between and months old had suggested that the he similar features which he attributed to the different individuals to one family or several families united by common similar observations had been made regarding the from other long in britain although martin smith and noted that this was not representative of a family group instead they stated that it would also be with a population that was still relatively small and in which most individuals were s team noted that in all but one case the are with dry bone three of the evidence that they had experienced violence a adult female had an injury on the left while an adult of sex had an on the left and a second adult female had a on the right analysis of the remains revealed that were of those found at many other southern british neolithic sites with significantly higher of which grew over time although this data is difficult to it was identified as probably a high in animal that over time was increasingly with river or in the case of the older individuals whose remains were in the tomb the was away and the had become exposed on the area of the dating of the remains suggested early neolithic activity began at the site during – or – when the first human remains were buried at the site it then suggested that after an of either – years or – years further of human remains were made inside the tomb this second probably began in – or – the dating of the human remains does not provide a date for the construction of coldrum long barrow itself it is possible that the individuals died either some time before or after the monument s construction post cut were identified on a number of the bones two two and one with suggesting that these had been created post as the bodies were and the bones removed from their however they further suggested that the lack of such cut on certain bones was that the body had already partial or the of prior to the process of the of the cut suggests that this was done they do not or of the that of were found on the bones this cut marked human bone represented the largest yet identified from within a neolithic long barrow in southern britain although similar evidence for has been found from a number of other neolithic british sites such as west and there are two for how this material developed the first is that the bodies of the dead were or exposed to the elements followed by a secondary burial within the tomb the second is that they were placed in the tomb where the flesh before the bodies were then within the tomb itself these practices may have been by or practices direct evidence for which does not the of over the bones was not unique to the site but common in tombs from southern england on the basis of an example discovered at kit s house thought it that the of the coldrum s chamber would have been by which served the same purpose as the side chambers of west and s damage and all of the surviving megalithic tombs from the early neolithic period have suffered from and the of although archaeologist paul noted that the coldrum stones represent kent s least damaged megalithic long barrow it too has suffered damage having become and over the six since its original construction most the eastern side has largely with the stones that once helped to hold up the side of the barrow having to the bottom of the it is possible that the at the bottom of the were not part of the original monument but were stones found in nearby fields which were there by excavation of long barrow revealed that it had been destroyed in one event and suggested that the same may have to the coldrum stones he believed that the stones around the barrow were laid in the surrounding and then buried during the late or early century by seeking to non christian monuments the archaeologist john alexander — who — suggested that the medway tombs were destroyed by seeking to within them as evidence he to the close of which ordered the opening of on the of in search for a practice which may have spread to kent around the same time alexander believed that the destruction n kent may have been brought about by a special that the and of the at would have beyond that which a local community could likely produce further suggested that in subsequent centuries the damaged coldrum tomb for and stone which was then re used as building material and tradition in a paper published in the journal john h evans recorded the existence of a local belief that a battle was fought at the site of the coldrum stones and that a black was buried within its chamber he suggested that the of taking place at this site and at other medway megaliths had not developed among the local population but had down from the of antiquaries who believed that the early battle of which was recorded in the took place in the area evans also recorded that there was a belief in the area that applied to all of the medway megaliths and which had been widespread up to the last generation this was that it was for any human being to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments this stones is not unique to this particular site and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in britain the earliest evidence for it is found in an early century where it to the stone circle of in although in an early seventeenth century it was being applied to the a set of three stone in later records that it had gained widespread distribution in england as well as a single each in wales and ireland the s p suggested that it could be attributed to an understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own in the early twenty first century a tradition developed in which the men a side to the site at every may day in order to up the sun this consists of a number of performed within the stones on top of the barrow followed by a song performed at the base of the monument and archaeological early the earliest accounts of coldrum long barrow were never published there are claims that at the start of the century the mark of prepared a plan of the site for s magazine although no copies have been produced to this between and the post remains at coldrum in which he described the monument although it remained at the time the site with the of britain s iron age post s was that the name coldrum derived from the and that the of some of the were there he further reported that in both and had been found at the site in an named thomas published a note on the coldrum stones and other medway megaliths in the archaeological journal had been to their existence by a local the b and proceeded to visit them with him describing the mentioned a smaller circle of stones to the others in the area with a in the middle he further added that it is a tradition of the that a line of stones ran from coldrum direct to the well known monument called kit s house this belief to the variety of megaliths which were throughout the in the j at the site with the help of the a report of their to the central committee of the british archaeological association describing the monument as a stone circle they asserted that they discovered at the site and noted that as well as being called the coldrum stones the monument also had the name of the stones which believed with the old english word for ad in august the archaeological institute who were then holding their week long meeting in took a tour to visit the site by the charles smith that year the monument was described in a of s magazine by charles moore who believed it to be a stone circle in the a lewis first visited the site and was by that several years previously a skull had been from inside or near to the chamber but that they believed it to be that of a a later account on this stating that two individuals in the centre of the without permission a human the skull of which was then re buried in the at in an note published in the journal of the institute of great britain and ireland lewis noted that while many visited kit s house very few to or ever of a yet more collection of stones at or coldrum he believed that the monument consisted of both a chamber and an of stones suggesting that they were two distinct in the archaeologist included the existence of the stones at in his list of although noting that a previous had described the stones as being in the shape of an he instead described them as a around the chamber he then included a small basic plan of the monument in august two amateur archaeologists george and a a came across the monument which they noted was known among as the coldrum stones and temple according to the stones were so with and that they could not be he returned the next year noting that at this point the had been cut away to the megaliths in his book noted that although it had first been described in in since that time no one seems to have taken the to record them or make a plan an unusual claim given that a of s published plan in his library for this reason after permission from the he convinced major a o green in survey at to a survey of the monument in august he also wrote to the archaeologist him to the coldrum stones as a protected site under the ancient monuments protection act described the coldrum stones as the monument of its class in the county and one of every care and attention it to other monuments of its type in britain he asserted that it was of to a period to the roman of britain also noted a tradition that there were stone coldrum to the long barrow although added that he was unable to any evidence for the existence of this feature in george published a note on the medway megaliths in the royal institute s journal man in which he referred to the coldrum stones as at once the most and the least known of the whole series suggesting that its design that it was built during a late date in the neolithic age he compared the in producing the megaliths to that at the stone circle of in although noted that they in that the coldrum stones represented a ultimately he ended his note by for the site to be protected under the ancient monuments protection act in that same issue lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an because he could see no evidence that anything of that kind ever and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle it to the examples at and drew suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine archaeological excavation the coldrum stones have been on multiple on april the amateur archaeologist f j began excavation at the site after previously having some neolithic from long barrow he soon discovered human bones under only a few inches of soil he returned to the site for further excavation in august this time with his and her both of whom were with an interest in on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull which they were able to largely a few days later he returned to on the north west of the with the e w that day they found a second skull further bones a and pieces of later that month george and f w met with to his with the aid of two other interested amateur archaeologists and miss both from excavation in early september in the archaeologists martin smith and asserted that s excavations had taken of the of that excavations should be recorded in full they noted that had provided clear plan and section photographs of the monument and attempts to site formation suggesting that the monument was constructed on land in his published report cited the ideas of james in the golden to that the coldrum stones monument may at one time have been dedicated though not initially so to the worship of the corn god and of he proceeded to that the human remains found at the site were the of human killed in however evans later stated that we have no means of whether human had taken place at the site in september once again began at the site this time with the aid of a of charles their project was through provided by the british association and the society of antiquaries with noting that at the time of its a had grown up around the site which had to be excavation continued until at least human remains were discovered and placed into the of sir arthur of the royal college of this excavation revealed all the existing surrounding the monument a number of which had previously been buried earth the stones of the were up with where deemed it necessary although excavation was it did stone stones and their relationship to the mound in noted that while from a present day it is possible to see in terms of the general standards of the early part of this century there is much to management by the national trust in his publication with kent the archaeologist o g s then working as the archaeological officer for the ordnance survey listed the coldrum stones alongside the other medway megaliths in the coldrum stones were given to the national trust who dedicated it as a memorial to the historian a was erected to mark this which the monument a stone circle in the archaeologist expressed the view that it is hoped that this may be in the near future still owned by the trust the site is open to visitors all year round free of charge on their website the trust visitors to look for views from the top of the barrow john h evans the

whose company he over that of other children his father had a interest in natural history and a love of and shooting rural in which he mortimer to take part robert acquired many books for his son particularly on the subject of art history with wheeler to both read and in wheeler joined school shortly before his ninth where he proceeded straight to the second form in robert and had a second daughter whom they named mortimer little interest in this sister in robert agreed to take over as head of the london office of his newspaper by then renamed the daily and so the family relocated to

london where he the national and the victoria and museum university and early career – after passing the entrance on his second attempt in wheeler was awarded a scholarship to read studies at university college london daily from his home to the university in central london at he was taught by the prominent a e during his studies he became of the union magazine for which he produced a number of illustrated increasingly interested in art he decided to from studies to a course at s art school the school of art he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than a picture this had affected his studies and he received a second class on wheeler began for a master of arts degree in studies which he in during this period he also gained as the personal secretary of the although he later criticised for the university from a college in the academic sense into a as little like a college as a is like a man it was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with tessa a student then history at when they were both serving on the committee of the university college society during his studies wheeler had developed his love of archaeology having joined an excavation of a british settlement in in a in the he won a that had been established by the university of london and the society of antiquaries in memory of the prominent archaeologist sir arthur evans the amount of money that went with the wheeler s proposed project had been to and with the grant he a trip to the in germany there the roman in

a because of this several have noted that the type specimen and thus the genus allosaurus itself or at least the species a is a dubious name based on a specimen too to to other specimens or to in an attempt to this situation s paul and a to the to have the name a officially transferred to the more complete specimen as a this request is currently review valid species it is how many species of allosaurus there were eight species have been considered valid since a a a the type species a fragilis the as yet not formally described a a a and a although only about half are usually considered valid at any given time there are also at least ten dubious or species that have been assigned to allosaurus over the years along with the species to now into allosaurus in the most recent review of

coined by in as the type species of his new genus and is based on what is now parts of three a and a following paul s work this species has been accepted as a of a fragilis allosaurus material from

of the formation the of the new species a it from other species of allosaurus in details however more material may show it to be a fragilis as originally described daniel s work on morrison remains has been responsible directly or for a and a a is the proposed name for a new species of morrison based on a nearly complete and skull a as it is also known from a fragilis in several details including a or with a straight lower and is also found only in the member of the morrison formation with a fragilis only present in the higher member a was coined by david k smith for s a created by in for giant remains from the morrison of these remains had been known as but that name was already in use leading to a smith in his analysis of variation concluded that s was not different enough from allosaurus to be a separate genus but did its own species a this was rejected in the most recent review of variation a and a fragilis the that there were two common allosaurus species in the morrison formation was in s paul s book of the world paul proposed that a fragilis had tall and a build compared to a second species a and was not a different due to allosaurus was originally named by marsh in as the type species of its own genus and is based on an of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull of nine tail two hip an and and foot bones although the idea of two common morrison species has had support in semi technical and popular works it has generally been rejected in the technical literature david k smith allosaurus by found that the specimens are generally smaller than those from or young university s dry but the of the bones themselves did not between the sites a later study by smith park and national monument specimens found no for multiple species based on variation skull variation was most common and was suggesting individual variation was responsible further work on size related variation again found no differences although the dry material to together on the basis of the an bone using skull elements from the site found wide variation between individuals calling into question previous species level based such features as the shape of the

commonly known as the earthstar the earthstar or the false earthstar is a species of fungus in the family young specimens resemble a when young and in the the earthstar shape that is a result of the layer of fruit body open in a star like the false earthstar is an species that in association with various trees especially in a hygrometricus has a distribution and is common in and tropical regions its common names refer to the fact that it is water and can open up its rays to the spore in response to increased and close them up again in conditions the rays have an surface while the spore case is brown and with an or at the top the gleba is white initially but turns brown and when the spores the spores are brown roughly with minute measuring – in diameter despite a similar overall appearance a hygrometricus is not related to the true of genus geastrum although they have been the species was first described by in as geastrum hygrometricus in andrew p proposed that differences in characteristics the creation of a new genus astraeus distinct from geastrum this opinion was not accepted by later authorities several asian thought to be a hygrometricus were renamed in the s once revealed they were unique astraeus species including a and a research has revealed the presence of several chemical compounds in the fruit bodies north american field typically rate a hygrometricus as and because this species the earthstar of geastrum it was placed in that genus by early authors starting with christian in as an of geastrum according to the american andrew p however the species from those of geastrum in not having open chambers in the young gleba having larger and not having a true and having larger spores set s as the type species of his new genus astraeus in despite s publication some authorities in the following decades continued to the species in geastrum the new based transferred the species back to the genus geastrum in the treatment of this species by certain well the that in for those who worship at the shrine of classification the only feature of those in which the species from others of geastrum is the somewhat in the developing plant the are by so as to be by the each is with somewhat arranged in like those of and not in the of the species which have been this difference as is reached when resemble closely the of any other member of the genus the is then unable to any point of difference by which astraeus may be from geastrum which that the name should be s treatment was not followed by later authorities who largely considered astraeus a distinct genus according to the authority of astraeus hygrometricus include geastrum geastrum and astraeus astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of names that to its behavior including the earthstar the earthstar the earthstar and the water earthstar the to geastrum species also known as true accounts for the common name false earthstar the specific name is derived from the greek words and the german society selected the species as their of the year in studies in the s that several species from asian collection sites under the specific hygrometricus were actually in a number of and characteristics studies of the of the its region of the from a number of astraeus specimens from around the world have helped to relationships within the genus based on these results two asian hygrometricus have been described as new species a and a with s a described in suggests that the european a hygrometricus described by is a different species than the north american version described by and that the european population may be divided into two distinct from france and from the a study identified a japanese species previously identified as a hygrometricus as distinct it has yet to

raaf during world war it was formed in march and covered the central portion of new south wales at sydney central area command was primarily responsible for air defence aerial and protection of the sea within its it was in august and control of its units taken over by other raaf in – to a new central area command did not come to history prior to world war the royal australian air force was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by raaf headquarters in after war broke out in september the raaf began to a form of command with expected in and units its initial move in this direction was to create and groups to control units in victoria and new south wales respectively then between march and may the raaf divided australia and new into four based command and control central area southern area western area and northern area the roles of these area were air defence protection of sea and aerial each was led by an air officer commanding responsible for the administration and operations of all air and units within his no group which had been established on november was re formed as one of the first two area central area on march in sydney central area command was given control of all air force units in new south wales except those in the southern and the north of the state units in were also assigned to its control the formation of northern area central area s was air king who had also led no group his senior air staff officer was wing commander in may it was reported that the area s headquarters building would change from in point to the nearby over command of central area to air bill anderson in december by august the raaf s program the establishment of training on a semi semi basis no training group was formed in sydney taking responsibility for the training units then under central area which was control of other central area units was divided as according to the official history of the war between northern and southern area the raaf s area command structure was in following the outbreak of the pacific war northern area was into north eastern area and north western area and a new command new south wales and southern eastern area was created making a total of five in october the air board proposed carving a new central area command out of eastern area which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore for this central area command would have been responsible for training and units in southern the war its decision on the the concept was raised again in august and this time the new central area command was to control units as well as training and operations in southern once again nothing came of the corn crake the corn crake or crex crex is a bird in the rail family it in europe and asia as far east as western china and to africa for the northern s winter it is a crake with or grey black on the wings and blue grey with and white on the and the strong bill is flesh the is brown and the and feet are grey are similar in to adults and chicks are black as with all there are no although individuals from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly than their western the male s call is a from which the scientific name is derived the corn crake is larger than its relative the african crake which its wintering range that species is also and has a face the corn crake s breeding is particularly and it uses similar on the wintering grounds this species a nest of grass in a in the ground and – which are covered with these in – days and the black chicks after about five weeks this crake is in decline across much of its former breeding range because modern practices often destroy before breeding is completed the corn crake is but mainly on the small or and plant material including grass and natural include introduced and large birds various and although numbers have declined in western europe this bird is as least on the red list because of its range and large apparently stable in russia and numbers in western china are more significant than previously thought and conservation measures have an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses despite its nature the call has the corn crake has been noted in literature and a range of local and names the are a bird family nearly species although of the group are lost in the largest number of species and least forms are found in the old world suggesting this family there the of the small is but the relative of the corn crake is the african crake which has sometimes been given its own genus but is now more usually placed in crex both species are short brown birds with a for rather than habitats of particularly the crake are near of the crex genus corn were first described by in his in as crex but was subsequently moved to the genus crex created by german and in and named crex the earlier use of crex gives it over s specific name and leads to the current name of crex crex the name crex crex from the ancient greek is to the crake s call the common name was as a single word but the official version is now corn crake the english names refer to the species of in dry hay or fields rather than used by most members of this family description the corn crake is a rail – cm – in long with a of – cm – in males g on average and females g the adult male has the crown of its head and all of its brown black in with or grey the wing are a with some white the face neck and are blue grey from a brown streak from the base of the bill to behind the eye the is white and the and are with and white the strong bill is flesh the is brown and the and feet are grey compared to the male the female has and a eye streak outside the breeding season the of both become and the less grey the is like the adult in appearance but has a yellow to its and the grey of the is replaced with brown the chicks have black down as with all while there are no all show great individual variation in and the birds gradually become and towards the east of the range adults a complete after breeding which is normally finished by late august or early september before to south eastern africa there is a pre breeding partial prior to the return from africa mainly involving the of the head body and tail young birds have a head and body about five weeks after the corn crake is with the african crake on the wintering grounds but can be distinguished by its larger size and different pattern in flight it has longer less wings and than its african relative and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing in both the breeding and wintering it is to be with any other since species are smaller with white on the different and a flying corn crake can resemble a but its wing pattern and are voice on the breeding grounds the male corn crake s call is a normally from a low with the bird s head and neck almost and its bill wide open the call can be heard from km mi away and serves to establish the breeding territory females and challenge males differences in mean that individual males can be distinguished by their early in the season the call is given almost at night and often during the day too it may be more than times a night with a between and am the call has to make a male s location clear as this species in the of calling after a few weeks but may again near the end of the period before away towards the end of the breeding season to males of their call can be produced by a piece of wood down a or by a credit against a or the male also has a call given with the bill and used during aggressive the female corn crake may give a call that is similar to that of the male it also has a sound similar in to the main call but without the quality the female also has a high call and a sound to call the the chicks make a contact call and a used to for food because of the difficulty in seeing this species it is usually by males calling between and am the birds do not move much at night whereas they may up to m during the day which could lead to double if then individual males suggests that just calling birds the true count by nearly and the is likely to be greater since only of males may call at all on a given night the corn crake is in africa distribution and the corn crake from britain and ireland east through europe to central although it has from much of its historic range this bird was once found in suitable habitats in between ° n and ° n there is also a population in western china but this species only rarely in northern and in old claims of breeding in south africa are and result from of in a museum collection which are actually those of the african rail the corn crake mainly in africa from the republic of the and central south to eastern south africa north of this area it is mainly seen on but occasionally in north africa and to the west and north of its core area in southeast africa most of the south african population of about birds occurs in and the former province and numbers in africa are there are several century records when were much higher than now of birds being seen in western europe mainly britain and ireland between december and february this crake to africa along two main a western route through and and a more important through egypt on passage it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering including much of west africa birds from following the western route in west africa on their way further south and again on the return flight when they also in or north africa eastern have been recorded in those parts of southern asia that between the east of the breeding range and africa further the corn crake has been recorded as a to sri and australia the canada the us

in africa it is more than the african crake and unlike its relative it is rarely seen in the open although it occasionally on tracks or road sides the corn crake is most active early and late in the day after heavy and during light its flight is and although less so than that of the african crake for longer flights such as it has a action with drawn up it with a high action and can run through grass with its body held and it will if essential when by a dog it will fly less than m ft frequently landing behind a or and then on landing if in the open this crake will often run in a for a short

to change much in the short term there are an estimated – million breeding in europe three of which are in european russia and a further – in russia the total population has been estimated at between and million individuals in much of the western half of its range there have been long term that are expected to continue although conservation measures have numbers to in several countries including a five increase in and a in the uk in the there were breeding territories in but this number had increased to at least by the breeding corn crake population had to decline in the th century but the process gained after world war the main cause of the in much of europe is the loss of and chicks from early dates have moved forward in the past century due to growth made possible by land and the use of and the move from grass cutting using to at first drawn and later by also means that large areas can be cut quickly leaving the crake with no alternative sites to either a first if suitable has or a replacement if the first nest is destroyed the pattern of typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre gives little chance of escape for the chicks which are also exposed to potential animal adults can often escape the although some females sit on the nest with results loss of is the other major threat to the corn crake from the reduced of and fields compared

steps to the corn crake and produce national management policies there is also an overall european action plan the focus of conservation effort is to and and to improve through the and method of hay later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed and leaving at the of fields and cutting from the centre the casualties from these changes is to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a large scale of and protection in countries where is still allowed are also conservation of the corn crake is being attempted in england and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries where breeding sites on urban areas there are cost estimated in one german study at several million per corn crake the corn crake does not appear to be threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from which more open habitats in culture most are birds that have made little cultural but as a common bird with a call that sometimes led to for rural the corn crake has acquired a variety of names and some in literature names the name for this species among has changed over the years with and of being at various times crake also had a period of between and the originally older was by thomas who used this term in his a history of british birds other names include corn and the latter term like king of the grass the french de and the german refer to the

someone with a or voice is illustrated in the to a woman with a voice like a who believed she was an this dates from at least the first half of the century and continues through to the present acute myeloid leukemia acute myeloid leukemia aml also known as acute leukemia or acute leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells by the growth of white blood cells that in the bone marrow and with the production of normal blood cells aml is the most common acute leukemia adults and its with age although aml is a relatively rare disease for roughly of cancer deaths in the united states its is expected to increase as the population the symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells which a in red blood cells and normal white blood cells these symptoms include of and and increased risk of several risk factors and abnormalities have been identified but the specific cause is not clear as an acute leukemia aml rapidly and is typically within weeks or months if left aml has several subtypes treatment and prognosis among subtypes aml is in – of people less than years old and – more than years old older people who are not able to chemotherapy have an average of – months aml is treated initially with chemotherapy at a people may go on to additional chemotherapy or a stem cell recent research into the of aml has resulted in the of that can which or may work best for a particular person as well as how long that person is likely to the treatment and prognosis of aml from those of leukemia in part because the is not the same aml higher of and cells

aml are often and and may be similar to those of or other common some symptoms include loss or loss of of or flat head under the skin caused by bone and joint and or frequent of the may in aml but it is typically and is rare in aml in contrast to acute leukemia the skin is involved about of the time in the form of leukemia rarely s a of the skin can with aml some people with aml may experience of the because of of leukemic cells into the rarely the first sign of leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or outside of the bone marrow called a occasionally a person may show no symptoms and the leukemia may be discovered during a blood test risk factors a number of risk factors for developing aml have been identified including other blood chemical and blood such as or disease can into aml the risk on the type of chemical exposure exposure to chemotherapy in particular can increase the risk of subsequently developing aml the risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy other chemotherapy and have also been associated with treatment related which are often associated with specific abnormalities in the leukemic cells chemical exposure to and other is as a cause of aml and many of its are known to be in while some studies have suggested a link between exposure to and increased risk of aml others have suggested the risk if any is high amounts of exposure can increase the risk of aml of the of and had an increased rate of aml as did exposed to high levels of rays prior to the of modern safety practices people treated with after treatment for cancer non cancer and cancer have the highest chance of aml but this increased risk to the background risk observed in the general population after years a risk for aml appears to exist multiple cases of aml developing in a family at a rate higher than by chance alone have been reported several conditions may increase the risk of leukemia the most common is probably down which is associated with a to increase in the risk of aml diagnosis the first to a diagnosis of aml is typically an result on a complete blood count while an of white blood cells is a common and leukemic are sometimes seen aml can also present with isolated in red blood cells or even with a low white blood cell count while a diagnosis of aml can be made by of the blood when there are leukemic a diagnosis usually requires an bone marrow and marrow or blood is under light as well as flow to the presence of leukemia to aml from other types of leukemia eg acute leukemia all and to the of disease a of marrow or blood is typically also for abnormalities by cytogenetics or in studies may also be performed to look for specific in such as and kit which may influence the of the disease on blood and bone marrow are in the

leukemia from all the diagnosis and classification of aml can be and should be performed by a or in cases the presence of certain features such as or specific flow results can aml from other however in the absence of such features diagnosis may be more difficult the two most commonly used classification for aml are the older french american british fab system and the world health organization who system according to the widely used who the diagnosis of aml is established by involvement of more than of the blood and or bone marrow by leukemic except in the three best prognosis forms of aml with abnormalities t and t in which the presence of the is of percent the french – american – british fab classification is a bit more a of at least in bone marrow or blood for the diagnosis of aml aml must be from conditions such as or which are treated because acute leukemia has the highest and requires a unique form of treatment it is important to quickly establish or the diagnosis of this of leukemia in performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose as it the t that there is also a need to the presence of which is an of that world health organization the who classification of acute myeloid leukemia attempts to be more and to produce more prognostic information than the fab each of the who contains numerous of interest to the and however most of the significant information in the who is via into one of the subtypes listed below the who subtypes of aml are acute of also known as mixed or acute leukemia when the leukemic cells can not be as either myeloid or cells or where both types of cells are present french american british the french american british fab classification system aml into eight subtypes m through to m based on the type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of this is done by the appearance of the cells with light and or by using cytogenetics to any abnormalities the subtypes have and to therapy although the who classification see above may be more the fab system is still widely used eight fab subtypes were proposed in the subtypes of aml also include rare types not included in the fab system such as acute leukemia which was proposed as a ninth m in the cell in aml is the in normal the is an of myeloid white blood cells a normal will gradually into a white blood cell in aml though a single changes which the cell in its state and prevent such a alone does not cause leukemia however when such a is combined with other which the result is the growth of an of cells leading to the of aml much of the and of aml is because leukemic can at a number of different steps along the modern classification for aml the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell and the leukemia may on the stage at which was specific abnormalities can be found in many people with aml the types of abnormalities often have prognostic significance the usually factors whose may cause the for example in acute leukemia the t produces a which to the acid element in the of several myeloid specific and myeloid the signs and symptoms of aml result from the growth of leukemic cells which to or with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow this leads to and the symptoms of aml are in turn often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements in rare cases people with aml can a or solid of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow which can cause various symptoms on its location an important of in aml is the induction of by that the of such as the and the and which lead to the generation of a novel which the activity of such as the is that such lead to the of and or the of treatment first line treatment of aml consists primarily of chemotherapy and is divided into two induction and or therapy the goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete by the number of leukemic cells to an level the goal of therapy is to eliminate any disease and achieve a cure stem cell is usually considered if induction chemotherapy or after a person although is also sometimes used as front line therapy for people with high risk disease efforts to use in aml continue induction all fab subtypes except m are usually given induction chemotherapy with and an most often this induction chemotherapy is known as or because the is given as a for seven consecutive days while the is given for three consecutive days as an up to of people with aml will achieve a with this other alternative induction including high alone like or may also be used because of the effects of therapy including and an increased risk of induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very and the may include less chemotherapy or care the m of aml also known as acute leukemia is almost treated with the all acid in addition to induction chemotherapy usually an care must be taken to prevent the treatment of when the release the of their into the circulation is with well treatment the goal of the induction is to reach a complete complete does not mean the disease has been rather it no disease can be with available methods complete is obtained in about – of newly adults although this may based on the prognostic factors described above the length of on the prognostic features of the original leukemia in general all will without additional therapy even after complete is achieved leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be with current techniques if no further or therapy is given almost all people with aml will eventually therefore more therapy is necessary to eliminate disease and prevent — that is to achieve a cure the specific type of therapy is based on a person s prognostic factors see above and general health for good prognosis t and t people will typically an additional three to five of chemotherapy known as chemotherapy for people at high risk of eg those with high risk cytogenetics or therapy related aml stem cell is usually recommended if the person is able to a and has a suitable the best therapy for intermediate risk aml normal cytogenetics or changes not into good risk or high risk groups is less clear and on the specific situation including the age and overall health of the person the person s and whether a suitable stem cell is available for people who are not for a stem cell with a of and after the of has been shown to the risk by to a increase in the of maintained aml for people with aml the only therapy is a stem cell if one has not already been performed in the agent was approved in the united states for people more than years with aml who are not for high chemotherapy this was from the market by its in since treatment for aml are so limited care or in a may be offered for acute leukemia arsenic is approved by the us like arsenic does not work with other subtypes of aml prognosis acute myeloid leukemia is a disease the chance of cure for a specific person on a number of prognostic factors cytogenetics the single most important prognostic in aml is cytogenetics or the structure of the leukemic cell certain abnormalities are associated with very good for example the in acute leukemia about half of people with aml have normal cytogenetics they fall into an intermediate risk group a number of other abnormalities are known to with a poor prognosis and a high risk of after treatment the first publication to cytogenetics and prognosis was the of later the group and eastern group and later still cancer and leukemia group b published other mostly of cytogenetics in leukemia aml which from a pre existing or disease so called secondary aml has a prognosis as does treatment related aml after chemotherapy for another previous both of these are associated with a high rate of abnormalities other prognostic in some studies age years and level were also associated with as with most forms of cancer performance status the general physical condition and activity level of the person plays a major role in prognosis as well a large number of are under study for their prognostic impact in aml however only and c kit are currently included in international risk these are expected to increase rapidly in the near future have been shown to a prognosis in aml with normal cytogenetics several have trials with mixed results two other and are associated with improved especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk are the significance of c kit in aml these are and because of the of such as and that can the activity of c kit it is expected that additional eg and that have been associated with an will soon be included in these the prognostic importance of other eg is less clear of cure cure in trials have from – although trials often include only people and those able to aggressive the overall cure rate for all people with aml including the and those unable to aggressive therapy is likely lower cure for leukemia can be as high as acute myeloid leukemia is a relatively rare cancer there are approximately new cases each year in the united states and the rate has remained stable from through aml accounts for of all cancer deaths in the united states the of aml with age the median age at diagnosis is years aml accounts for about of all acute in adults but is rare in children the rate of therapy related aml that is aml caused by previous chemotherapy is therapy related disease currently accounts for about – of all cases of aml aml is slightly more common in men with a male to female of there is some variation in the of aml in adults the highest are seen in north america europe and while adult aml is in asia and latin america in contrast aml is less common in north america and india than in other parts of asia these differences may be due to population environmental factors or a of the two uk aml accounts for of all cases in the uk and around people were with the disease in history the first published description of a case of leukemia in medical literature dates to when french louis described a year old who developed an by stones and of the and noted the blood of this person had a like and the appearance of the blood was due to white in a series of people who died with and changes in the and of their blood was reported by the based he used the term to describe this condition the term leukemia was coined by the german in as a in the use of the light in was the first to describe the of white blood cells in people with the described by and as was of the of the white blood cell he used the term leukemia greek white blood to

reception in some with critics that it was and or allowed others to it for purposes the german historian the first edition as a most book which to anti israeli holocaust historian israel called the book a stating this is not research it t even political literature don t even think it should be reviewed or as a book the book was also criticized by brown university professor and university of chicago professor peter however holocaust scholar said the book expressed views himself to in in that he too found the of the holocaust as finkelstein describes asked on another if finkelstein s analysis might play into the hands of nazis for purposes well even if they do use it in that m that when it comes to the it has to be said without to any that would be other critics claim finkelstein s evidence is highly and or dubious and that his would be based on a of history and a use of sources the historian david wrote that while finkelstein banks of serious towards holocaust and depicts them as of a jewish based on a from an important report he had the report body which describes actions by banks of accounts to keep records and so on criticism of dershowitz s the case for israel shortly after the publication of the book the case for israel by dershowitz finkelstein it as a collection of plagiarism and during a debate on now finkelstein asserted that dershowitz knowledge about specific of his own book he also claimed that dershowitz did not write the book and may not have even read it finkelstein noted in as many where dershowitz s book the same sources and used by peters in her book in largely the same with in the same places in two dershowitz peters s see below from this finkelstein concluded that dershowitz had not the original sources himself to the latter s claims finkelstein suggests that this of amounts to ideas a of a of dershowitz s book he managed to he found evidence that dershowitz had his assistant in the library the sources he had read in peters s book dershowitz the charge in a letter to the university of s press director that finkelstein had made up the gun in that he had changed its from to in his book in public debate he has stated that if the without going to back on whether mark had said that that would be a serious charge however he that he himself did not do that that he had the original source by dershowitz threatened action over the charges in finkelstein s book as a of which the the word plagiarism from the text before publication finkelstein agreed to the that dershowitz was not the true author of the case for israel because as the said he t that that he did the original sources dershowitz said finkelstein is simply him of good practice citing he learned of initially from peters s book dershowitz that he used any of peters s ideas without plagiarism is taking someone else s words and claiming they re your own there are no words from there are no ideas from because with the of peters s book in a in the case for israel which peters s book dershowitz that he on peters for or data in their joint interview on now however finkelstein cited specific in dershowitz s book in which a that he says peters coined was attributed to george peters coins the she says she s using it as a play off of george which as all know used the she coined her own you go to dershowitz s book he got so in his massive from peters that on two them for those who have a of the book on and on he uses the george s is not dershowitz you re the at you must know that would never use such a as james o the former president of college the university of and the american academy of arts and has defended dershowitz do not finkelstein s charge of plagiarism against dershowitz there is no claim that dershowitz used the words of others without when he uses the words of others he them and generally them to the original sources mark palestine royal commission finkelstein s is that instead he should have cited them to the secondary source in which dershowitz may have come upon them but as the chicago of style importance of with all of others materials it is important to the original as the source this not only the claims of use it also avoid any of plagiarism this is what dershowitz did to an article in the nation by alexander dershowitz also cited the chicago of style s claim is that some of the should not have been cited to their original sources but rather to a secondary source where he upon them even if he were that found all these in peters s book the method of is to the original source as the chicago of style with all of others materials it is important to the original as the source this avoid any of plagiarism to a source from a secondary source in is generally to be to which responded the chicago of style dershowitz that he followed the rules by citing the original as opposed to the secondary source peters he chicago here where the original means the of the material which is in this instance peters now look at the second bit of the from chicago from the by a three point as my has discovered this passage to a source from a secondary source occurs on which is no less than later than the material before the in a section titled taken from secondary sources here s the full with what dershowitz left out set in in to a source from a secondary source in is generally to be since authors are expected to have the works they if an original source is however both the original and the secondary source must be listed so chicago is that unless dershowitz went to the he was to peters finkelstein has demonstrated that he didn t go to the plagiarism added time for of the language of chicago s together two separate on of dershowitz law school asked former president to the of plagiarism dershowitz of the charge in an april interview with the dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last september to depaul members against finkelstein s tenure in april frank a former in chief of the law review published an analysis of the charges made against finkelstein by dershowitz no in any single charge and that dershowitz had in a follow up analysis he concluded that he could find no way of the that dershowitz the from from peters s from time immemorial and not from the original source as dershowitz claimed in an interview given for the film american the trials of norman finkelstein in dershowitz said of finkelstein don t think he is a he s jewish only on his parents side tenure and in september dershowitz sent members of depaul s law and political science what he described as a of norman finkelstein s most academic and especially his and and and to finkelstein tenure de paul s political science committee his against finkelstein and concluded that they were not based on criticism the department subsequently invited john and two independent with known on the israel – palestine conflict to the academic of finkelstein s work they came to the same also in the washington post noted the accused norman finkelstein of being a holocaust and that these charges have proved finkelstein s mother survived the concentration camp his father survived the concentration camp and most of his family died in the holocaust in early the depaul political science department voted nine to three and the college of arts and personnel committee five to in of giving finkelstein tenure the three opposing members subsequently a report opposing tenure supported by the of the college stated he opposed tenure because finkelstein s personal and attacks on dershowitz and the holocaust authors and jerzy were with depaul s as examples of the latter argued that finkelstein respect for the dignity of the individual and for the rights of others to hold and different positions public debate dershowitz to finkelstein s tenure in june a – by depaul university s board on promotion and tenure a board by the university s president the denied finkelstein tenure the university denied that dershowitz who had been criticized for his campaign against finkelstein s tenure played any part in this decision at the same time the university denied tenure to international studies assistant professor a strong of finkelstein despite support from her department the personnel committee and the finkelstein stated that he would in civil if attempts were made to him from teaching his students the council later the right of finkelstein and to appeal which a university said was not possible council president said she was concerned was not followed depaul s association considered taking no on including the president because of the tenure in a issued upon finkelstein s depaul called him a scholar and an outstanding dershowitz expressed at the and this in particular saying that the university had traded for peace in june after two weeks of protests some depaul students a sit in and strike in support of both denied tenure the conference of the american association of university also sent a letter to the university s president stating it is entirely for a university to tenure to a professor out of fear that his published research might a college s and that the association has rejected as an for members in a interview professor author of out of academic freedom and the question of palestine described the finkelstein tenure case as one of the most significant academic freedom cases in the last years claiming the case demonstrated the pressure outside parties can place on a mid religious institution when the advanced by a scholar interests denied entry to israel in on may finkelstein was denied entry to israel according to security officials because of involving elements in and that he did not give a full to with to these finkelstein had previously visited south and met with families during the war he was banned from entering israel for years finkelstein was after his at airport near and for hours in a holding cell after speaking to israeli michael he was placed on a flight back to his point of in an interview with finkelstein stated did my best to provide and to all the put to me am that have nothing to no suicide missions or secret with organizations he had been to visit friends in the west bank and stated he had no interest in israel said finkelstein from entering the country the behavior of the soviet countries reception finkelstein s books are an attempt to the works of scholarship the authors whose work he has thus including daniel and dershowitz along with others such as whose work finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship have in turn accused finkelstein of their work and from their books according to finkelstein academic to the when no one else is out there to support him would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is and that those who in the end are right and he will be among those who will have it so seems at great cost in a review for beyond chutzpah said that finkelstein has a most track record in american jewish scholarship on the israeli conflict he praised finkelstein for all the for which he has become famous attention to and skills stated that her shared experience with finkelstein as a child of holocaust engaged in research on the palestinian israeli conflict gave her a unique position to according to finkelstein s scholarship is both for its and in the fields of middle eastern studies and political science his work is considered and there is no that both would be without it norman s power and value however do not only from his scholarship but from his character his life ’ s work shaped largely but not entirely by his experience as a child of has been and continues to be by a with human dignity and the of the israeli newspaper stated that t is difficult to with finkelstein s and especially since he decided to support meet with its and visit the of some of its still it continued to say that he should not be banned from entering israel because with do not in themselves a security risk film about finkelstein american the trials of norman finkelstein is an award winning documentary film about the life and career of norman finkelstein released in and directed by david and it has been in in toronto hot and in more than other national and international it received a rating of on film review the same year finkelstein appeared in a documentary film by award winning israeli criticism criticism has been against finkelstein from several the first sources are from those whose work finkelstein has daniel whose book s willing finkelstein criticized claimed his scholarship has everything to do with his political dershowitz has written that peter professor of history at the university of chicago and a noted holocaust historian whose work finkelstein says inspired the holocaust industry has strongly criticized the latter s work describing it as similarly dershowitz whose book the case for israel and finkelstein s response beyond chutzpah an between the two has claimed finkelstein s in a against pro israel scholars the of attack is the target and finkelstein to the writings in minute and that the writer didn t actually write the work that it is that it is a and a that finkelstein has charges against many calling at least distinguished jews and although the back and forth between finkelstein and dershowitz received the most attention and attracted significant controversy finkelstein has maintained that the real issue is israel s human rights record israeli historian writing for the new york times book review the holocaust industry to be by the same he in those who the holocaust for or politics it is with the kind of that finkelstein in much of the current media over the holocaust it is with the same to historical inner politics and dubious and it with the same sense of moral and like any it contains several of and like any such it is both and finkelstein has accused of or being an to of palestinian prisoners during his service in the first based on made in s book prisoners finkelstein says that to prisoners to the which he says has been as in human rights reports referred to the as and he had never laid a hand on said his role was making prisoners had fruit he finkelstein as a figure and accused him of and my book on israel finkelstein is a critic of the state of israel finkelstein s book beyond chutzpah israeli historian stated that finkelstein s of israel is based on an amount of research he seems to have read everything he has through the reports of israeli groups of human rights groups human rights and peace now and b all of the reports of international and he all this evidence from israeli and other sources in order to his of israeli practices israeli of human rights of the israeli house the of palestinian the cutting down of trees the building of the wall — the security on the west bank which is — the on the in the west bank and so on and so forth find his well and in a interview with today s in finkelstein stated think israel as a number of out is becoming an state and we have to be about that while the rest of the world wants peace europe wants peace the us wants peace but this state wants war war and war in the first week of the there were reports in the israeli press that israel did not want to put all its ground forces in because it was attacks on then there were reports it was planning attacks on it is a state when asked how he as the son of holocaust felt about israel ’ s operation in finkelstein it has been a long time since felt any emotional connection with the state of israel which and and these it is a state there is a russian writer who once described states as khan with a israel is khan with a feel no of with that state have some good friends and their families there and of course would not want any of them to be that said sometimes feel that israel has come out of the of the a state the anti league has described finkelstein as an anti with of and israel on being called an anti finkelstein has said it s a term am opposed to any state with an ethnic character not only to israel finkelstein is an of a two state to the israeli palestinian conflict and finkelstein has expressed with and with respect to defensive actions that israel had as a of when was seeking a settlement with israel he also what he said was israel s to by international law and to by the opinion of the international community to the conflict was of course happy to meet the people because it is a point of view that is rarely heard in the united states have no problem saying that do want to with them and am not going to be a of a about it don t care about as a political organization don t know much about their politics and it s don t live in it s a choice that the have to make who they want to be their leaders who they want to represent them but there is a people have the right to their country from foreign and people have the right to their country from who are their country that to me is a very basic elementary and question while the of to achieve a political goal finkelstein has stated he has the right to target israeli as long as israel in until israel its acts finkelstein claims that an between and the state of israel in to the military policy of during the second according to finkelstein the record shows that israel has for killing and israel he that the among human rights organizations at any rate is that in effect there ’ s no difference between killing and finkelstein argued one of israel s primary for the offensive in was that was that it wanted a settlement of the conflict along the june border finkelstein had joined the international community in seeking a settlement and describes s towards israel prior to the war as a peace offensive on the bds movement finkelstein had made many of the and movement finkelstein stated that think the movement has the right support the bds but said it will never reach a broad public until and unless they are on their goal and their goal has to include recognition of israel otherwise it s a he has stated that he a bds making the same point about and goals in february the jewish in england stated that finkelstein launched a attack on the bds movement saying it was a cult the cult in that to as human rights while in reality their goal is to destroy israel finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few and that just like a cult the leaders that they are successful when in reality the general public their extreme views in june in an appearance on now finkelstein on his of the bds movement the problem as see it with the bds movement is not the who could not support and of course you should and most of the human rights organizations church organizations have moved in that direction the problem is the goal the official bds movement they claim to be — term you want to use — on the question of israel you can ’ t reach a broad public if you are on the question of israel the broad public wants to know where do you and if you claim not to have a you them the bds movement it always says and ’ m using their language we are a rights based organization we are based in international law with that that ’ s where you have to go rights based international law but the international law is clear you read the last of the international court of opinion on the wall that israel has been building in the west bank and the last says we look forward to two states a palestinian state alongside israel and at peace with its that s the law and if you want to go past that law or the israel part you ’ never reach a broad public and then it s a cult then it ’ s in my opinion we re time and it s only a of time it becomes — and know it s a strong word and won t be for it but it becomes because there was a time where we said it made no difference was you could you want — who but now actually we can reach people there is a possibility ’ m not saying a m not even saying a but there is a possibility that we can reach a broad public and so we have to be very about the words we use and we have to be very about the political

several of the including as described in the old books and the commandments form part of a offered by god to the to free them from the spiritual of sin according to the catechism of the catholic church — the official of the catholic church s christian beliefs — the commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth and serve as the basis for catholic social a review of the commandments is one of the most common types of of used by catholics before receiving the of the commandments appear in the earliest church writings the catechism states that they have occupied a place in teaching the faith since the time of of ad – the church had no official standards for religious until the fourth council in evidence suggests the commandments were used in christian education in the early church and throughout the middle but with emphasis the lack of in them by some formed the basis of one of the launched against the church by the first church wide catechism in provided of each commandment but gave greater emphasis to the seven the most recent catechism a large section to each of the commandments church teaching of the commandments is largely based on the old and new and the writings of the early church in the new jesus their and his to go further a that of the and by jesus into two great commandments that love of god and love of they individuals on their relationships with both the first three commandments demand respect for god s name of the lord s day and the worship of other gods the others deal with the relationships between individuals such as that between and child they include against and the old to ten individual commandments even though there are more than ten in the two texts – and – the old does not make clear how the texts should be divided to at ten commandments the division used by the catholic and was first derived by the latin church father of – in his book on other christian such as the eastern and some use a form established by the greek the two forms have slightly different but the same despite to the jewish from christian in that it considers what many call a to be the entire first commandment history the ten commandments are recognized as a moral foundation by and they first appear in the book of according to which acting under the of god the from physical in egypt according to church teaching god offered a — which included the ten commandments — to also free them from the spiritual of sin some historians have described this as the central event in the history of ancient israel the coming of jesus is seen by the catholic church as the of the of the jews who were according to peter kreeft to show the true god to the world jesus the commandments and his to go further in kreeft s words more not less a which that of the and church teaching kreeft states the commandments are to the moral order what the creation story in is to the natural order they are god s order chaos they are not man s ideas about god but god s ideas about man the church that jesus people from the jewish law or law with its distinct but not from the to keep the ten commandments because the ten were written with the of god unlike those written by this teaching was at the council of – and at the second vatican council – although it is what role the ten commandments played in early christian worship evidence suggests they were during some services and used in christian education for example the commandments are included in one of the earliest christian writings known as the teaching of the or the scholars that the commandments were highly regarded by the early church as a of god s law the scholar that the church replaced the commandments with of and such as the seven from – other scholars that throughout church history the commandments have been used as an of and that many have written about them while evidence that the commandments were part of in and other there was no official church position to promote specific methods of religious during the middle the fourth council was the first attempt to this problem surviving evidence that some efforts to the council s included special emphasis on teaching the commandments in their centuries later the lack of in them by some formed the basis of one of the launched against the church by produced in specific from the mid century the commandments and laid the foundation for the first official church wide catechism the roman catechism commissioned by the council of it provided of each commandment but gave greater emphasis to the seven to the catholic belief that christian life was upon the obtained through the life provided by the catholic church this emphasis with beliefs which held the commandments as the source of divine while more recent offer of church teaching on individual commandments throughout history official church on the commandments are based on their in the old and new and the writings of the early church and later thomas and offered notable on the commandments a of the church considered them to be the primary of and all law and natural reason gives to them as being the most recent catechism of the catholic church — the official of church beliefs — a large section to the commandments which serve as the basis for catholic social teaching according to the catechism the church has given them a place in teaching the faith since the fifth century kreeft explains that the church them as a of life and a to freedom just as a children from life first commandment the first commandment according to church teaching means that must worship and god alone because god is alone the catechism explains that this examples of practices such as the worship of any and of demons power pleasure race the state and money interpreted this commandment as love god and then do what you will this kreeft states that all sin serves some other god another commander the world or the flesh or the if god be then one will do what god the catechism this commandment with the three the first faith catholics to believe in god and avoid and the second catholics against and according to the catechism the last can be met only if catholics from or toward god and avoid spiritual and a of god from the catechism specific of this commandment including and all practices of magic and it further and or the catechism the latter actions to a for power over time history and in the last analysis other human beings as well as a to powers images while catholics are sometimes accused of images in violation of the first commandment the church says this is a in the church s opinion the honor paid to sacred images is a not the due to god alone in the th century over whether religious in this context paintings were prohibited by the first commandment the was almost entirely to the eastern church the to while the supported their a position by the western church at the second council of in the council determined that the of and statues was not in violation of the commandment and stated an image the person in it at around the time of the controversy over the western church began to use sculpture which by the period became a major feature of western christian art that has remained part of the catholic tradition in contrast to eastern which large religious sculpture the catechism using very traditional that god gave permission for images that christian by leaving such as the and the on the of the it states that by becoming the son of god introduced a new economy of images the united states conference of catholic the catechism in their book united states catechism for adults published in regarding images they that this command that in ancient times expressed itself in the worship of such things as the sun stars trees bulls and as well as and kings they that today itself in the worship of other things and list some as power money and sports second commandment the second commandment the use of god s name in many ancient believed that names were sacred some had on when a person s name could be the of john an incident where a group of jews attempted to stone jesus after he used a sacred name of god to refer to himself they interpreted his as a claim of since they did not believe that he was god they considered this which under law a death penalty kreeft that all of the names by which god is known are holy and thus all of those names are protected by the second commandment the catechism states respect for his name is an of the respect to the of god himself and to the whole sacred reality it the catechism also requires respect for the names of people out of respect for the dignity of that person the behind this commandment is further in the lord s which begins our father who art in heaven be name according to pope when god revealed his name to he established a relationship with states that the was the of a process that had with the giving of the divine name that this means the divine name could be and that jesus of be name is a for the of god s name to protect the of his to us and constantly his true identity as opposed to our of it according to catholic teaching this commandment does not the use of god s name in taking by authority however under god s name for purposes or words of or against god are considered of third commandment the jewish and scholar pope explains that to israel this commandment was more than it was a way to god who on the seventh day after the creation it also the core of the social order although a few christian follow the practice of the on catholics along with most sunday as a special day which they call the lord s day this practice dates to the first century from their belief that jesus rose from the dead on the first day of the week the on to come together on the lord s day to break and give is the first to sunday rest we however just as tradition has taught us on the day of the lord s to guard not only against but every and office of even our we give any place to the de ad nation in the sixth century of taught that the whole of the jewish had been transferred to sunday and that must keep sunday in the same way as the jews were to keep the the council of in this to the law of the jewish to the of the christian sunday as jewish and non christian the church leaders of later centuries sunday rest into official church teaching and christian have attempted to the sunday rest throughout history for catholics jesus teaching that the was made for man not man for the means that good works when the of others demand it can be part of the day of rest the catechism offers on how to the lord s day which include mass on and holy days of on these days catholics may not work or do activities that the worship due to god but performance of the works of and in a of are permitted according to the this commandment has been for catholics as one of the church the organization the dies because the are to mass unless there is a grave have the duty to offer the real possibility of the yet more than a the should be seen as a need from the of christian life it is important that all the should be convinced that they cannot live their faith or share fully in the life of the christian community unless they take part in the sunday fourth commandment pope states that this commandment as the heart of the social order it relationships makes the connection between family order and and that the family is both and protected by god because parents love for their children god s love and because they have a duty to pass the faith on to their children the catechism the family a church a community and the original cell of social life the catechism says this commandment requires duties of children to parents that include respect toward parents that also to brothers and sisters as expressed in a from that through your parents you were born what can you give back to them that their gift to you to parents for as long as the child lives at home when it is for his good or the good of the family except when would the child to do something support that requires grown children to offer material and moral support for their parents particularly at times of or this commandment according to the catechism also requires duties of parents to children which include moral education spiritual formation and of their children respect for their children as children of god and human persons for children while being not to them pressure to a certain or which does not parents from giving being a good example to their children their own to their children to and them jesus expansion the of that when told his mother and brothers were to see him jesus who is my mother and who are my brothers his hand over his he said here are my mother and my brothers for does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and my sister and mother pope stated that this of jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level by doing god s will any person can become part of the universal family of jesus thus the fourth commandment s to the greater society and requires respect for social authorities the catechism duties of citizens and nations which kreeft as and honor to all who for our good have received authority in society from god of the right to and one s country an to be and critical which requires citizens to that which human dignity and the community a duty to civil authorities and that are to the moral order to practice which is a for any working family or society it is the greatest social commandment and requires people to love god and to the who is in need of security and that cannot be found in his own country an for nations to help poor nations especially in times of need an for families to help other families fifth commandment this commandment respect for human life and is more as not murder killing may under limited circumstances be within jesus expanded it to anger and and to to love their enemies the basis of all catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the of life which kreeft is opposed to the quality of life a which he as introduced by a book the permission to destroy life of life see life of life and which he was the first to win public by german before world war — the basis and beginning of nazi medical practices this is supported by modern medical that the by these opposing to who must make life or death decisions some the use of the nazi as when applied to quality of life decisions arthur called this the church is involved in the public over capital punishment and and to support legislation and it describes as pro life the catechism states human life is sacred because from its beginning it the action of god and it remains in a special relationship with the creator who is its end no one can under any claim for himself the right directly to destroy an human being direct and killing of an human is considered a sin considered by the church to be of an even greater is the murder of family members including the murder of a and the catechism states that the must be treated from as a person the latin original of as is meaning like or just as although the church has not determined officially when human life actually begins it has taken the course of that human life is present from the moment of or respect for life at all even potential life is generally the context of church has been and by the church since the first century formal in the penalty of by the very commission of the already passed the catechism that this penalty is not meant to but that it makes clear the of the crime and the done to the child its parents and society formal in not just to the mother who but also to the and who directly in the act the church has of such as project for those who of their sin of formal in official church teaching for medical and intended to protect or the mother s health if she would be in without them even when such some risk of death to the examples include the of a in the case of an pregnancy of a pregnant or an use of for research or the united states catechism for adults a section to in stem cell research and in its of the fifth commandment because these often the destruction of human considered to be a form of murder stem cell research is called an means to a good end and citing the for the of the faith s on respect for human life in its and on the dignity of the us no even though in itself such as a to science to other human beings or to society can in any way on living human or whether or not either inside or outside the mother s body the note that adult stem cell research using cells obtained with is a field of research that is suicide the fifth commandment suicide and the killing of those who are even to eliminate suffering the care of those facing an death may not be according to the church care to food water and relief and does not include care which to the use of or that are considered allowing a person to using that may their life or treatment to the such as chemotherapy or are considered and not a violation of the fifth commandment in with the of double effect capital punishment for the first two years refused to kill in the military in self defense or in the system but there was no official church position on the death penalty when the church was first officially recognized as a public institution in its toward capital punishment became one of but not the death penalty had support from early catholic though some of them such as saint members of the not to or out capital punishment saint to capital punishment in the first commandment in the city of god thomas and argued that civil authority to out capital punishment was supported by pope required peter and the to accept that power can without sin of blood provided that it with not out of with not as a for with the church paul states that official church have neither nor promoted capital punishment but of it has throughout the the provide the most instance of church support for capital punishment although some historians considered these more than the of the period the catechism of the catholic church states that the death penalty is in cases of extreme it is allowed if the party s identity and responsibility have been fully determined and if the death penalty is the only way to others against the party however if there are other means available to people from the these are because they are considered to be more of the dignity of the person and in with the common good because modern have means for crime without the catechism the cases in which of the is an are very rare if pope john paul and this in published in personal health dead bodies burial according to church teaching respect for human life requires respect for one s own body behavior the of food and the church also against the opposite behavior of with the health and of the body that physical and success at sports and are as well as that are not for medical reasons according to the catechism have a moral to to provide living conditions for all people church belief in the of the body led to a against that was at the second vatican council in the s under limited circumstances but those conditions have been largely even by the according to the catechism burial of the dead is a work of that must the body with respect and love eg of remains burial in an grave are in the catholic church after death and under certain terms also for legal and scientific reasons are permitted war and self defense in the on the mount jesus the commandment you not kill and then to it the against anger and going further his to love their enemies the catechism that it is to on respect for one s own right to life kreeft says self defense is for the same reason suicide is not because one s own life is a gift from god a we are responsible for and the catechism that someone who his life is not of murder even if he is forced to deal his a defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others the defense of the common good requires that an be unable to cause for this reason those who hold authority also have the right to use arms to against the civil community to their responsibility the church requires all to and work to prevent but for just if certain conditions are met the reasons for going to war are defensive the damage by the must be grave and certain it is a last taken only after all other means of an end to the grave damage have been the aim is peace and there is a serious chance of success no are produced that the evil to be eliminated this the use of arms to eliminate whole cities and areas with their respect and care is required for non wounded soldiers and prisoners soldiers are required to to and ones that universal the catechism under the fifth commandment and it as an or behavior which leads another to do evil in the of jesus stated one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a great round his neck and to be in the depth of the sea the church considers it a serious crime to cause another s faith and love to be especially if it is done to young people and the is a person of authority such as a or sixth commandment according to the church humans are sexual beings whose sexual identity should be accepted in the of body and soul the are meant by divine design to be different and each having dignity and made in the image of god sexual acts are sacred within the context of the relationship that a complete and gift of a man and a woman sexual thus not just the body but the person s whole being in his book the of john paul on this concept after all young people are always searching for the in love they want their love to be if they give in to following the of behavior that can be considered a in the contemporary world and these are widely in the of their they still a and love this is as true of boys as it is of girls ultimately they know that only god can give them this love as a result they are willing to follow without about the this may like and the catholic church considers all sexual acts outside of marriage to be grave the of the sin one from until of and in to church teaching on the sixth commandment includes a on the catechism describes as a moral a gift from god a a fruit of spiritual effort the church sex as more than a physical act it also body and soul so the church that is a all people are called to it is as the inner of a person s and spiritual being that successfully a person s sexuality with his or her entire human nature to this are to into the long and work of self that is helped by god s and education that the moral and spiritual of human life the catechism of the sixth commandment into two against and against the dignity of marriage against the catechism the following against in increasing order of the church that sexual pleasure is good and created by god who meant for to experience pleasure and of body and kreeft says does not mean sexual pleasure as such nor the in it nor the for it in its right context is the for sexual pleasure alone outside its intended purpose of and the of man and woman body and soul in self is considered for the same reasons as but is a step above in that it a physical act instead of a one is the sexual union of an man and an woman this is considered to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality because it is not ordered to the good of or the generation and education of children higher because it is considered a of the sexual act that is intended for distribution to third parties for is considered for both the and the it a person to an of sexual pleasure human dignity and society the of the is less for who are forced into the act by or social pressure is an evil act that can cause grave damage to the for life or of children by parents or other adult or those responsible for the education of the children to them is considered the most of sexual the catechism a separate section to within its of the sixth commandment like acts outside of marriage acts are considered the church between which are not considered and acts which are the catechism states that they natural law cannot bring forth life and do not from a and sexual under no circumstances can they be approved the church that a is and can be a great for the person who the church must be accepted with respect and in their should be are according to the church called to they are to practice the of self that inner freedom using the support of friends and found in the of the church these are meant to help gradually and approach christian which is a state to which all are called two represent opposing regarding to change the church s to acts international is an organization of who support each other in the effort to live in and in to and his church love of and wife according to church teaching love is intended to form an two end the union of and wife and the of life the includes the of each s being so that they are no longer two but one flesh the of is as god s the which the together church teaching on the state requires of each other s and and the recognition that the call to in marriage is one that requires a process of spiritual growth and that can last throughout life of marriage sexual pleasure birth control the church position on sexual activity can be as sexual activity only in marriage as an of total self giving and union and always open to the possibility of new life sexual acts in marriage are considered and and are meant to be with and sexuality is to be to marriage by its very nature love requires the of the this is the of the gift of themselves which they make to each other love to be it cannot be an until further the union of marriage as a giving of two persons and the good of the children demand total from the and an union between them birth control the catholic church has these methods throughout its history in response to the church of england the practice of in the catholic church issued the on december the is a of the catholic church s traditional view of marriage and and a continued of birth control the church seeing large families as a sign of god s by its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is ordered to the and education of the and it is in them that it its children are the gift of marriage and greatly to the good of the parents themselves true married love and the whole structure of family life which results from it without of the other ends of marriage are directed to the to with the love of the creator and who through them will increase and his family from day to day it that responsible sometimes for or of and considers natural family planning as but all methods of the church all forms of and because the techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child the catechism states a child is not something to one but is a gift the gift of marriage many western catholics and non catholics have on the church s support for natural family planning and it to and the church s of use is widely criticized in particular with to countries where the of and has reached in its defense catholics countries such as and where changes are instead of use and where greater in the disease has been made than in countries that promote use alone against the dignity of marriage according to the church and divorce are considered against the dignity of marriage and are as follows is the sexual union of a man and woman where at least one is married to someone else it is for this reason that the church considers it a greater sin than kreeft states the against his his society and his children as well as his own body and soul divorce according to the catholic new american jesus taught his wife unless the marriage is her to and a woman church of this teaching kreeft says jesus considered divorce to be an that had into jewish law the church that marriage was created by god and was meant to be like the creation of a child that cannot be created neither can the one flesh of the marriage the catechism states divorce is a grave against the natural law it claims to break the contract to which the to live with each other death by another the person to the of the as the is considered to be in a state of public and permanent the of the catechism other against the dignity of marriage free and sexual acts before or outside of marriage civil divorce according to the church there are that do not to
